# REPL client/server example

A quite simple example of a
[Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
client/server application.

The scope is to open the server on a specific port and wait for a client to
connect. Once the client is connected, the server will read the input from the
client, evaluate it, and send back the result to the client.

Only until the client or the server decide to close the connection, the client
can send messages to the server.
