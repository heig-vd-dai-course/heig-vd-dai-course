## Objectives

In this chapter, you will learn about the different electronic messaging
protocols with a focus on the SMTP protocol. You will also learn how to use the
SMTP protocol to send an email to an SMTP server using ncat and a Java client.

## Electronic messaging protocols: SMTP, POP3 and IMAP

There are three main protocols used for electronic messaging:

- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

You could use any email clients (called **Mail User Agents (MUA)** in the RFCs)
such as Thunderbird, Gmail or Outlook to use these protocols. They will send and
receive emails from an email server (called **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)** in the
RFCs).

### SMTP

SMTP is the protocol used to send emails. It is a simple text-based protocol
that uses TCP port 25, 465 or 587. The port 25 is used for unencrypted
connections, while the ports 465 and 587 are used for encrypted connections. The
port 587 is the newer and recommended port for encrypted connections.

It is used by email clients to send emails to an email server.

### POP3

POP3 is a protocol used to retrieve emails. It is a simple text-based protocol
that uses TCP port 110 or 995. The port 110 is used for unencrypted connections,
while the port 995 is used for encrypted connections.

It is used by email clients to retrieve emails from an email server.

### IMAP

IMAP is a protocol used to retrieve and synchronize emails. It is a more complex
protocol that uses TCP port 143 or 993. The port 143 is used for unencrypted
connections, while the port 993 is used for encrypted connections.

It is used by email clients to synchronize emails from and to an email server
between the email server and the email client. This means that if you read an
email on your email client, it will be marked as read on the email server, while
POP3 does not allow this.

## DNS records related to email

When you send an email, your email client will use the DNS to find the IP
address of the email server. Then, it will use the IP address to send the email
to the email server.

To find the IP address of the email server, your email client will look for the
following DNS records:

- `MX`: This record specifies the email server that will receive emails for a
  given domain name. For example, the `MX` record for `heig-vd.ch` is
  `heigvd-ch01b.mail.protection.outlook.com.`.
- `A`: This record specifies the IPv4 address of a given domain name. For
  example, the `A` record for `heig-vd.ch` is `193.134.223.20`.
- `TXT`: The `SPF` record, as stated by CloudFlare
  (<https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record>),
  _"[] are a type of DNS TXT record commonly used for email authentication. SPF
  records include a list of IP addresses and domains authorized to send emails
  from that domain."_. For example, one of the `TXT` record contains these
  information for `heig-vd.ch`.

You can check these records by running the following command with
[dig](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)>):

```sh
dig heig-vd.ch any
```

The `any` option allows to display all DNS records for the given domain name. By
default, dig will only display the `A` records.

The output should be similar to the following:

```text

```

The output is more verbose than with `nslookup`, but it contains the same
information.

Note the `ANSWER SECTION` line. The `A` record the IP mapping the DNS record.
The `MX` record is the email server that will receive emails for the given
domain name. One of the `TXT` contains the `SPF` records with `v=spf1 [...]`.

## Security concerns and spam

The email protocols are quite old and were not designed with security in mind in
the first place.

If we look at the SMTP protocol, we can see that:

- SMTP does not require authentication
- SMTP does not require encryption
- SMTP does not require the sender address to be valid
- SMTP does not require the sender address to be the same as the email address
  used to authenticate
- And many other issues

Because of this, SMTP is often used by spammers to send spam emails. To prevent
this, there are many denylists that contain IP addresses of known spammers. If
an email server is on a denylist, it will not be able to send emails to some
email servers.

Maintaining email servers is a complex task that requires a lot of knowledge
about the protocols and the security issues. This is why many companies use
third-party email services such as Google or Microsoft 365.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Considering these security flaws, please be aware that spoofing an email
> address is really not that hard. However, the HEIG-VD has a strict policy
> regarding the use of its email addresses.
>
> If you are caught spoofing an email address, you could get in trouble. Please
> use the Mailpit SMTP server for your tests to avoid any issues.

In this course, we will use what is called a mock server. A mock server imitates
the functionalities of a real server for testing purposes. In this case, we will
use a simple SMTP server with a web interface to send and check emails.

A really simple SMTP server called Mailpit can be used and run with Docker for
exactly this purpose: <https://github.com/axllent/mailpit>.

## A focus on the SMTP protocol

The SMTP protocol is described in
[RFC 5321](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321).

It uses the TCP protocol on port 25, 465 or 587. It is a text-based protocol
with the following commands (among others):

- `HELO` or `EHLO`: Used to identify the sender
- `MAIL FROM`: Used to specify the sender email address
- `RCPT TO`: Used to specify the recipient email address
- `DATA`: Used to specify the email content
- `QUIT`: Used to close the connection

To send an email, you will need to use the following commands:

```text
EHLO <sender>
MAIL FROM: <sender email address>
RCPT TO: <recipient email address>
DATA
<email content>
.
QUIT
```

The following diagram shows the sequence of commands to send an email:

![Sequence diagram of the SMTP protocol](./images/a-focus-on-the-smtp-protocol-2.png)

## ncat

[ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) is a client/server network utility that can read
and write data across network connections using the TCP or UDP protocols.

ncat can be used to connect to many services such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP,
etc.

In this course, we will use ncat to connect to an SMTP server and send an email.

ncat can be used to test services such as SMTP and/or to configure network
devices such as routers that you might have to configure during your career.
This is why we will use it in this course for local testing.

## Practical content

### Install and configure ncat

In this section, you will install and configure ncat on your operating system.

#### Install ncat

ncat is a widely used network utility that is available on most operating
systems.

Install ncat using the package manager of your operating system:

```sh
# Install ncat on Ubuntu
sudo apt install ncat
```

#### Check the installation

You can check the installation by running the following command:

```sh
# Check the installation
ncat --version
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
Ncat: Version 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
```

### Start Mailpit

Pull the latest changes from the previously cloned
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository or clone it if you have not done it yet.

Explore the `15-smtp-and-ncat` directory containing the Mailpit example with
Docker Compose. Make sure to show hidden files and directories to see the `.env`
file.

In the `15-smtp-and-ncat` directory, run the following command:

```sh
# Start Mailpit in background
docker compose up -d
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
[+] Running 4/4
 â mailpit Pulled                                  5.4s
   â 43c4264eed91 Already exists                   0.0s
   â acf8b88d34d5 Pull complete                    2.4s
   â 345ad78f8587 Pull complete                    2.5s
[+] Running 2/2
 â Network 15-smtp-and-ncat_default      Created   0.2s
 â Container 15-smtp-and-ncat-mailpit-1  Started   0.4s
```

This will start the Mailpit SMTP server and the Mailpit web interface.

Display and follow the logs of the container with the following command:

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

The `-f` option allows to follow the logs. To stop following the logs, you can
press `Ctrl` + `C`.

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
mailpit-1  | time="2024/10/26 08:49:01" level=info msg="[smtpd] starting on [::]:1025 (no encryption)"
mailpit-1  | time="2024/10/26 08:49:01" level=info msg="[http] starting on [::]:8025"
mailpit-1  | time="2024/10/26 08:49:01" level=info msg="[http] accessible via http://localhost:8025/"
```

You can access the Mailpit web interface at <http://localhost:8025>.

### Send an email to Mailpit with ncat

In this section, you will send an email with ncat to the Mailpit SMTP server.

#### Connect to the SMTP server

Now that Mailpit is running, you can send an email with Telnet.

Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```sh
ncat -C localhost 1025
```

The `-C` option allows to use the CRLF line endings. This is required by the
SMTP protocol.

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
220 f3a8189f0ff4 Mailpit ESMTP Service ready
```

This means that you are connected to the Mailpit SMTP server.

#### Send an email

In the ncat session, run the following commands. Each command should return you
a status code. Feel free to change the content of the email (you must keep the
`<>` characters):

Say hello to the SMTP server:

```text
EHLO the-smtp-domain-name.tld
```

Tell the SMTP server who you are:

```text
MAIL FROM: <your-email@gmail.com>
```

Tell the SMTP server who the recipient is:

```text
RCPT TO: <recipient@example.com>
```

Start the email content:

```text
DATA
```

Set the email headers

```text
Subject: Your Subject
```

```text
From: Your Name <your-email@gmail.com>
```

```text
To: Recipient Name <recipient@example.com>
```

```text
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
```

An empty line is required between the headers and the content:

```text

```

Set the email content:

```text
Your email content goes here.

It can be multiple lines.

A line with a dot (.) by itself indicates the end of the email content.
```

```text
.
```

The SMTP protocol relies on the `MAIL FROM:` and `RCPT TO:` commands to specify
the sender and recipient email addresses. As SMTP does not require
authentication, you can specify any email address you want. SMTP will then
accept the email and send it to the recipient email server, regardless of the
sender email address. This demonstrates the security issues related to SMTP and
why it is often used by spammers and mail spoofers to social engineer people as
the email will be sent from a trusted domain.

In order to spoof an email address, you need to have access to an SMTP server
and send the email from this SMTP server that you share in your network.

The `From:` and `To:` are used by the email client to display the sender and
recipient names. They are not related to the SMTP protocol. They are part of the
email content and helps to display the email content in a human-readable way.

The `.`, on a line by itself, indicates the end of the email content.

The output should be similar to this:

```text
250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as YXmrXP7s4GwckUDLoqVSnk
```

The mail has been sent to the Mailpit SMTP server. You can check it in the
Mailpit web interface at <http://localhost:8025>.

Congratulations! You have sent your first email with ncat!

As you can see, the commands used to prepare and send the email are quite
simple. However, the email content is not. This is why we use email clients
instead of ncat to send emails.

These commands follow the SMTP protocol, just as any other application protocols
such as the ones you created in a previous chapter and the ones you will create
in the future.

To quit the SMTP session, run the following command:

```text
QUIT
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
221 2.0.0 f3a8189f0ff4 Mailpit ESMTP Service closing transmission channel
```

To exit ncat, press `Ctrl` + `C`.

### Send an email to Mailpit with a Java SMTP client

In this section, you will send an email with Java to the Mailpit SMTP server.

#### Explore the Java client

Explore the `SmtpClientExample.java` file in the `15-smtp-and-ncat` directory.

The Java client uses the `java.net.Socket` class to connect to the Mailpit SMTP
server and send an email.

#### Run the Java client

Compile the Java client:

```sh
# Compile the Java client
javac SmtpClientExample.java
```

Run the Java client:

```sh
# Run the Java client
java SmtpClientExample
```

#### Check the email

The email should be sent to the Mailpit SMTP server. You can check it in the
Mailpit web interface at <http://localhost:8025>.

### Stop Mailpit

To stop Mailpit, run the following command:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This will stop and remove the Mailpit container.

### Go further

This is an optional section. Feel free to skip it if you do not have time.

- Are you able to send an email with a CC recipient?
- Are you able to send an email with a BCC recipient?
- Are you able to send an email with HTML content?
- Are you able to send an email with an attachment?

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have had a refresh about networking with IP adresses and
DNS records. You have also learned about the SMTP protocol and how to use ncat
to send an email to an SMTP server.

Based on the official RFC, you have learned that SMTP is a simple text-based
protocol to send emails with rather simple commands.

With the help of Mailpit and Docker, you have now a way to test your emails with
a fake SMTP server (called a _mock server_) for all your other applications!

### Test your knowledge

At this point, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- What are the difference between SMTP, POP3 and IMAP?
- What are the DNS records related to email?
- What are the security concerns related to email?
- What is ncat?
- What are the SMTP commands to send an email?
- What is the difference between the SMTP commands and the email content?
