## Evaluation format

In order to validate this part of the course, you will have to pass an
evaluation.

The evaluation will last **60 minutes** and the questions will be in French. You
can answer them in French or English.

The evaluation dates will be as follows:

- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **25.11.2024**
- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **29.11.2024**

---

The evaluation will be done on paper and is made up of two parts.

Once you have finished the first part, come to the teacher's desk to hand it in
and you will receive the second part.

Once you have finished the second part, you can leave the room quietly.

You cannot get the first part back once you have handed it in.
