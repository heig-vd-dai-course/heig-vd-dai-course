## Introduction

Network applications are everywhere. They are used to communicate, to play
games, to watch videos, to listen to music, to browse the web, to send emails,
etc.

In this practical work, you will create your own network application.

The network application will be defined by an application protocol and two
processes that communicate over the network.

The application protocol and the network protocol(s) it uses (TCP and/or UDP)
will be defined by you.

Feel free to be creative! For example, you can choose to create a chat
application, a chess game, a shopping list, the simulation of an Internet of
Things (IoT) network, etc. If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we
can give you.

Multiple groups can choose the same idea and you can share your methodology and
take inspiration from/help each other. However, you are not allowed to
plagiarize the code of another group. You will be penalized if you do so with 1
as the final grade.

## Objectives

- Define a network application protocol
- Implement a network application that can be used by multiple clients at the
  same time using the TCP and/or UDP protocol(s)
- Package, publish and run a network application with Docker

You will work in groups of two or three students. You can choose your
partner(s). If you do not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: [DAI 2025-2026] Practical work 2 - <first name member 1> <last name
  member 1>, <first name member 2> <last name member 2> and <first name member
  3> <last name member 3> (if applicable)
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Please do it a before the next week**, even if you do not have a clear idea
> yet as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> **If you do not open the discussion before next week, you will be penalized
> (-0.2 point on the final grade).**

## Idea validation

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

This will ensure that you have a good balance between the complexity of the
practical work and the time you have to complete it.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can help you finding some
ideas.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> While the grading criteria might not be as detailed as in the previous
> practical works for each section, you **must** continue to apply all the good
> practices you have learned so far.
>
> If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
> practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might
> penalize you.
>
> Remember the UNIX philosophy and the KISS principle: _Keep it simple, silly!_

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course to implement the network
  application (you can use any other libraries for other aspects of the
  application, such as UI, etc.)
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)

## Tips

### Create diagrams

You can use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), [draw.io](https://draw.io/),
scans paper diagrams or any other tools you want to create your diagrams.

PDF, PNG, SVG, etc. are all accepted formats in your repository.

### Extract the command and parameters from the message

The Short Message Service (SMS) protocol presented in the
[_"Define an application protocol"_](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol)
chapter (accessible in the
[examples](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository) defines the following message:

```text
RECEIVE <message> <username>
```

This message is sent by the server to a client to inform them that they have
received a message from another user.

The command is `RECEIVE` and the parameters are `<message>` and `<username>`.

The message can be up to 100 characters long.

You can use the following snippet of code to extract the command and the
parameters from the message:

```java
// Extract the command and the parameters from the message and store them in a
// List. The first element of the List is the command and the second element is
// the parameters.
//
// The second parameter of the split method is the maximum number of parts
// that can be created. If the message contains more than one space, the
// remaining parts will be added to the last part.
List<String> messageParts = Arrays.asList(emitterMessage.split(" ", 2));

// Get the command from the message
String command = messageParts.get(0);

// Switch on the command
switch (command) {
  // Other cases can be defined here...
  case "RECEIVE" -> {
    // We check that the message contains at least two parts (the command and
    // its parameters). If not, the message is invalid (from the application
    // protocol) and we ignore it (or we can send an error message to the
    // client).
    if (messageParts.size() < 2) {
      System.out.println("Invalid message, ignoring...");
      break;
    }

    // Get the parameters from the message
    List<String> parameters = Arrays.asList(messageParts.get(1).split(" "));

    // Check that the parameters contains at least two parts (the message and
    // the user). If not, the message is invalid and we ignore it (or we can
    // send an error message to the client).
    if (parameters.size() < 2) {
      System.out.println("Invalid message, ignoring...");
      break;
    }

    // Get (and remove) the user from the parameters (the last part)
    String user = parameters.removeLast();

    // Join the remaining parts with a space to form the message
    String message = String.join(" ", parameters);

    // Do something with the message and the user
    System.out.printf("Message from %s: %s\n", user, message);
  }
  // Other cases can be defined here...
}
```

### The POSIX standard

> The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard is a family of
> standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility
> between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system and user-level
> application programming interfaces (APIs), along with command line shells and
> utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of
> Unix and other operating systems.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>

Not all programs are/can be POSIX compliant. But if you try to comply with the
POSIX standard, you will be able to run your program on various operating
systems without any issues.

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
