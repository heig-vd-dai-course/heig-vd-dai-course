## Evaluation format

In order to validate this part of the course, you will have to pass an
evaluation.

The evaluation will last **60 minutes** and the questions will be in French. You
can answer them in French or English.

The evaluation dates will be as follow:

- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **11.10.2024**
- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **14.10.2024**

---

The evaluation will be done on the computer with the help of the HEIG-VD online
evaluation platform.

You must be connected to the _**HEIG-VD**_ network or connected to the VPN to
access the evaluation platform.

Once you are done, mark your evaluation as done and you can leave the room
quietly.

A dummy evaluation will be available before the evaluation so you can
familiarize yourself with the platform. The link will be sent to you via GitHub
Discussions.
