## Java

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Java

- General-purpose, object-oriented language.
- Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
- Created by James Gosling, 1995 at Sun Microsystems.
- The documentation seems scary but you will get used to it and it is very
  useful.

![bg right h:60%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg)

### Java virtual machine

- Compiles source code to bytecode.
- Executes the bytecode in the Java virtual machine (JVM).
- Where a JVM exists, Java can run (most of the time).

![bg  right w:85%](./images/java-api-specification.png)

### JVM versions

- Multiple implementations exist.
- Can target different platforms and/or specific features.
- JDK for development, JRE for running.
- Eclipse Temurin is recommended.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/which-version-of-jdk-should-i-use.png)

### Java versions and version managers

- Java 21 is the latest LTS.
- You can use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to manage multipe versions of Java.
- Match versions for project consistency.

![bg right w:80%](https://sdkman.io/assets/img/sdk-man-small-pattern.svg)

### Compiling and running Java programs (1/3)

Given the following `HelloWorld.java` file:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Hello, World!";

        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

### Compiling and running Java programs (2/3)

You can compile and run Java programs in multiple ways:

- Compile manually with the `javac` command:

  ```sh
  javac HelloWorld.java
  ```

- Execute with the `java` command:

  ```sh
  java HelloWorld
  ```

### Compiling and running Java programs (3/3)

- Modern way: package into JAR files with the help of Maven and run with the
  `java -jar` command:

  ```sh
  java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.20.1.jar nogui
  ```

### Garbage collection

- Java has automatic memory management: we do not need to manually manage memory
  as in C or C++.
- The garbage collector (also called _"GC"_) runs periodically to free memory.
- Eligible when an object is no longer referenced (out of scope or `null`).

### Summary

- Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
- Java is compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by a Java virtual machine
  (JVM).
- Java is intended to be portable, thanks to the JVM.
- Java has various versions, each with its own set of features and improvements.
- Versions managers allow you to install and switch between different versions
  of Java.

## IntelliJ IDEA

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### IntelliJ IDEA

- IDE for (Java) software development.
- Developed by JetBrains.
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux.
- Quite a standard in the industry.

![bg right w:60%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/IntelliJ_IDEA_icon.svg)

### Community Edition and Ultimate Edition

- Community (free) and Ultimate (paid).
- Free student license available - you can get it!
- The Community Edition is sufficient for this course.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/intellij-community-and-ultimate-edition.png)

### JetBrains Toolbox App

- Manage multiple JetBrains IDEs.
- Install and update in one place.
- Optional but very useful.

![bg right w:60%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/Toolbox_icon.svg)

### Configuration files and Git

- `.idea` directory for project config.
- Allow to share project settings between developers.
- Some files must be ignored to avoid issue (local config) in Git.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/gitignore-example.png)

### Summary

- IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java
  for developing computer software.
- IntelliJ IDEA is available in two editions: the Community Edition (free and
  open-source) and the Ultimate Edition (proprietary).
- You are eligible for a free student license for the Ultimate Edition.
- When creating a new project, IntelliJ IDEA will create a `.idea` directory
  containing the project configuration files.
- Some of these files must be ignored by Git, as they contain local
  configuration that is specific to your computer.

## Maven

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Maven

- Maintained by Apache Software Foundation.
- Software project management tool.
- Manages dependencies.
- Build automation tool.
- Allows to define a standard project structure.

![bg right w:80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Apache_Maven_logo.svg)

### Maven project structure

- Standardized directory structure:
  - `src/main/java`
  - `src/main/resources`
  - `src/test/java`
- Simplifies build process with conventions.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/maven-project-structure.png)

### `pom.xml` file

- Configuration and build settings.
- Shared among developers.
- Defines dependencies and plugins:
  - Plugins extend Maven functionality.
  - Dependencies are external libraries.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/maven-pom-file.png)

### Maven lifecycle

- Maven defines build process.
- Composed of phases and goals.
- Phases load plugin goals.
- Goals execute tasks on your project (e.g., compile, test, package).

![bg  right w:85%](./images/maven-lifecycle.png)

### Maven Repository

- Public repository of Java libraries.
- Maven can download dependencies automatically.
- You can publish your own libraries.
- Many libraries available such as picocli, a library for building CLI
  applications.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/maven-repository.png)

### Maven wrapper

- Allows to use Maven without installing it.
- Wrapper script downloads Maven.
- Ensures consistent Maven version.
- Use `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` instead of `mvn`.

![bg  right w:85%](./images/maven-wrapper.png)

### Summary

- Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.
- Maven is a dependency manager for Java projects.
- Maven is a build automation tool for Java projects.
- Maven defines a standard directory structure for Java projects.
- Maven defines a standard build process for Java projects.
- The `pom.xml` file contains the configuration of your Maven project.
