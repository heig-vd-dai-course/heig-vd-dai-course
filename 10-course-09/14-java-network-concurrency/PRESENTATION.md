[code examples](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)**.

Answer the questions available in the course material:

- How do the code examples work?
- What are the main takeaways of the code examples?
- What are the main differences between the code examples?

If needed, use the theoretical content to help you.

## Concurrency: an introduction

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Concurrency: an introduction

- Ability to handle multiple tasks at the same time
- Differs from parallelism, the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously
- Before we dive into concurrency, let's take a step back and remember what a
  processor is

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554564200-198b0cd87cf5?fit=crop&h=720)

### What is a processor?

- Piece of hardware that executes millions of instructions every second
- Gives the illusion of executing multiple tasks at the same time
- However, it can execute only one instruction at a time
- When managing multiple tasks, the processor switches between tasks

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1698440050363-1697e5f0277c?fit=crop&h=720)

### What is a core?

- A physical unit inside a processor that executes instructions (always one at a
  time)
- A processor can have multiple cores, called multi-core processors
- Cores can execute multiple instructions at the same time (parallelism) - not
  covered in this course

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1716772911614-7e830fb35765?fit=crop&h=720)

### What is a process?

- A process is an instance of a program that is being executed
- A process can have multiple threads (such as picocli)
- Processes are isolated from each other and have their own memory space
- Heavier than threads: expensive to create and manage

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1718154621829-881f65a74a8c?fit=crop&h=720)

### What is a thread?

- A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a core
- A core can manage multiple threads at the same time
- The main thread is the thread that starts when the application starts
- More lightweight than processes and share the same memory space

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1717444309226-c0809d4b5bde?fit=crop&h=720)

### What problems can concurrency cause?

- What happens when a client connects to the server?
- How to isolate the data sent by one client from the others?
- What happens when multiple clients want to access the same resource
  (variables) at the same time?

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606987482048-c6826204b417?fit=crop&h=720)

### What happens when multiple threads access the same resource?

- The processor has to switch between threads
- The order in which the threads are executed is not guaranteed
- The threads can access the same resource at the same time

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506951796365-405279289a75?fit=crop&h=720)

## Handling one client at a time

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Handling one client at a time

1. Create a socket to listen to incoming connections
2. Create a new socket for the client
3. Handle the connection

Analogy: a restaurant with one table

➡️ Simple but quite useless...

## Handling multiple clients with concurrency

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Handling multiple clients at the same time

Handling multiple clients at the same time is called concurrency.

Concurrency can be achieved with:

- Multi-processing
- Multi-threading
- Asynchronous programming

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559329007-40df8a9345d8?fit=crop&h=720)

### Multi-processing

- Create an entirely new process for each client
- Heavyweight and slow
- Not recommended
- Analogy: a new restaurant for each customer, including the kitchen, waiters,
  etc.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1562835155-1fa627c69744?fit=crop&h=720)

### Multi-threading

- Create a new thread for each client
- More lightweight and faster than multi-processing
- Recommended with thread pool to limit resource usage
- Not enough or too many threads can slow down the system
- Analogy: a new or limited number of tables for each customer

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559674437-65de136f4a05?fit=crop&h=720)

### Asynchronous programming

- Handle multiple clients with a single thread
- Very performant!
- Analogy: a food truck - you get a ticket, wait, get your food and leave
- Out of scope for this course but interesting to know! Node.js is a good
  example for this approach

## Handling multiple threads in Java

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Handling multiple threads in Java

- Java provides the
  [`ExecutorService`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html)
  interface to manage threads
- It uses different
  [`Executors`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html)
  implementations
- Each implementation has its own pros and cons
- You have used threads with picocli (each sub-command is a thread)

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529133396358-0f5f0c4a1c8a?fit=crop&h=720)

---

```java
@Override
public Integer call() {
  try (ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); ) {
    executorService.submit(this::emittersWorker);
    executorService.submit(this::operatorsWorker);
  } catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("[Receiver] Exception: " + e);

    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}

public Integer emittersWorker() {
  // Manage emitters
}


public Integer operatorsWorker() {
  // Manage operators
}
```

## Concurrent safe variable types and data structures in Java

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Concurrent safe variable types and data structures in Java

- A thread-safe variable type and/or data structure is a variable type/data
  structure that can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time
- Java provides several thread-safe variable types and data structures

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552879890-3a06dd3a06c2?fit=crop&h=720)

---

- **Variables types**:
  - `AtomicBoolean` instead of `boolean`/`Boolean`
  - `AtomicInteger` instead of `int`/`Integer`
  - `AtomicLong` instead of `long`/`Long`
- **Data structures**:
  - `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `HashMap`
  - `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` instead of `LinkedList`
  - `CopyOnWriteArrayList` instead of `ArrayList`
  - `CopyOnWriteArraySet` instead of `HashSet`

---

- Multiple concurrent variable types and/or data structures can be co-dependent
- You must use them together with locks (the equivalent to mutexes and
  semaphores in C/C++) to avoid inconsistencies

Locks will not be covered (and not expected to be used) in this course but you
can find additional information in the [course material][course-material].
