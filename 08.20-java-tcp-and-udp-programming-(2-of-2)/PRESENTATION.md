## Objectives

- Learn the differences between TCP and UDP and reliability
- Learn what an UDP datagram is
- Learn the different ways to send a UDP datagram to one or multiple clients
- Learn UDP in the Socket API
- How UDP can be used for service discovery

## Explore the code examples

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Explore the code examples

Individually, or in pair/group, **take 10 minutes to explore and discuss the
[code examples](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)**.

Answer the questions available in the course material:

- How do the code examples work?
- What are the main takeaways of the code examples?
- What are the main differences between the code examples?

If needed, use the theoretical content to help you.

## UDP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### UDP

- A transport layer protocol just like TCP
- Connectionless protocol - does not require to establish a connection before
  sending data
- Unreliable protocol - does not guarantee delivery but is fast
- Analogy: sending postcards through the postal service

## Differences between TCP and UDP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Differences between TCP and UDP

- TCP
  - Connection-oriented
  - Reliable
  - Stream protocol
  - Unicast
  - Request-response
  - Used for FTP, HTTP, SMTP, SSH, etc.

---

- UDP
  - Connectionless
  - Unreliable
  - Datagram protocol
  - Unicast, broadcast and multicast
  - Fire-and-forget, request-response (manual)
  - Service discovery protocols
  - Used for DNS, streaming, gaming, etc.

## UDP datagrams

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### UDP datagrams

- Datagrams = discrete chunks of data (packets) sent over the network
- Sent individually and independently
- Contain a header (source and destination ports, length, checksum, etc.) and a
  payload (data)

![bg right contain](./images/udp-datagrams.png)

## Reliability

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Reliability

- UDP is unreliable (no guarantee of delivery, no guarantee of order)
- The application must implement its own reliability mechanism
- In some cases, reliability is not needed (e.g. streaming)
- Handling reliability is complex - not covered in this course

## UDP in the Socket API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### UDP in the Socket API

- `DatagramSocket` is used to send and receive datagrams
- A datagram is created with the `DatagramPacket` class
- A multicast socket is created with the `MulticastSocket` class.

![bg right contain](./images/datagram-socket.png)

## Unicast, broadcast and multicast

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Unicast, broadcast and multicast

- Unicast, broadcast and multicast are ways to send data over the network
- TCP is unicast only
- UDP can be unicast, broadcast or multicast

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542783863-dbe5c9693402?fit=crop&h=720)

### Unicast

- One-to-one communication
- One sender and one receiver
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The IP address of the receiver
  - The port of the receiver

Think of it as a private conversation between two people

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Unicast.svg)

### Broadcast

- One-to-all communication
- One sender and multiple receivers
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The subnet
  - The port
- `255.255.255.255` for all hosts

Think of it as a public announcement.

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Broadcast.svg)

### Multicast

- One-to-many communication
- One sender and some receivers
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The multicast address (between `239.0.0.0` and `239.255.255.255`)
  - The port

Think of it as a group conversation.

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Multicast.svg)

---

- Just as with broadcast, it can be blocked by routers
- Multicast is quite guaranteed **not** to work on the public Internet
- Made for the local network
- Multicast is a complex topic
- Not covered in depth in this course
- The course material contains some resources

## Messaging patterns

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Messaging patterns

- Fire-and-forget
  - One-way communication
  - No response
  - No guarantee of delivery
- Request-response
  - Two-way communication
  - Response
  - Guarantee of delivery (manual)

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533219057257-4bb9ed5d2cc6?fit=crop&h=720)

## Service discovery protocols

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Service discovery protocols

- Discover services on the network
- Two types of protocols
- Service discovery protocol patterns:
  - Advertisement (passive)
  - Query (active)
