## Introduction

We use command line interface (CLI) tools every day. For example, we use Git to
manage our code (with its `git` command line interface), Maven to build our
projects (with its `mvn` and `mvnw` command line interface), Java to run our
programs (with its `javac` and `java` command line interface), etc.

In this practical work, you will create a CLI using
[picocli](https://picocli.info/) to process files.

The CLI will take an input file and an output file as arguments. It will also
take optional arguments to customize the CLI (such as the input file encoding
and the output file encoding - the default being UTF-8 for example). The CLI
will process the input file and write the result in the output file. It will
display a message on success and a message on failure.

You have the freedom to define what the CLI will do. You can be creative! For
example, you can choose to transform a text file (find/replace/count number of
occurrences/etc.), to grayscale a JPEG/PNG binary file manipulating its pixel
values, add metadata to existing TIFF files, etc.

Multiple groups can choose the same idea and you can share your methodology and
take inspiration from/help each other. However, you are not allowed to
plagiarize the code of another group. You will be penalized if you do so with 1
as the final grade.

## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files with Java IOs
- Practice Java, Maven and [picocli](https://picocli.info/)
- Practice a Git workflow to share your work with your team

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two or three students. You can choose your
partner(s). If you do not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: [DAI 2025-2026] Practical work 1 - <first name member 1> <last name
  member 1>, <first name member 2> <last name member 2> and <first name member
  3> <last name member 3> (if applicable)
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Please do it a before the next week**, even if you do not have a clear idea
> yet as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> **If you do not open the discussion before next week, you will be penalized
> (-0.2 point on the final grade).**

## Idea validation

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

This will ensure that you have a good balance between the complexity of the
practical work and the time you have to complete it.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can help you finding some
ideas.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

### Category 3 - Java, IntelliJ IDEA and Maven

| 15  | The codebase is built with Maven and outputs an executable JAR file so the application can be ran everywhere Java is installed                                                                     |    0.2 |

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course to open/close the files -
  you can use any other libraries to help you once the files are opened if need
  (see the [External dependencies](#external-dependencies) section)
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)

## Tips

### The Unix philosophy and the KISS principle

> The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms
> and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It
> is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>

The Unix philosophy is a set of rules that defines how Unix programs should be
designed. It is used to define the Unix operating system and the programs that
are used on this operating system.

The Unix philosophy can be defined by the following rules, among others:

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

You can inspire yourself from the Unix philosophy to define your own
applications.

The KISS principle summarizes the Unix philosophy in a simple sentence: _Keep it
simple, silly!_

Sometimes it is better to use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

### External dependencies

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project with the
dependencies available on the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) to
help you build your application. You must however explain why and how you use it
in your README.

As mentioned in the [Constraints](#constraints) section, you cannot use an
external dependency that manages the files for you (open/close the files).

### Add members to your repository

You can add your team members to your repository as collaborators to allow them
to push directly to the repository.

**If your project is private, do not forget to add the teaching staff as
collaborators to allow us to see your work!**

### Protect your main branch

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

You can check the official documentation to know how to protect your main branch
on GitHub:
<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule>.

### How and what to present

You are free to present your work as you want. You can use slides, a live demo,
a small theater piece, etc.

However, it is not necessary to remind us the objectives of the practical work:
we know what you have to do but we do not know what you have done and how you
have done it - focus on that.

Focus your presentation on the _"what"_ and the _"why"_ and present the core
aspects of your application: there is no need to present us the code as we will
dig in deeper while grading your work. Present some code only if it is something
critical and/or very unique/interesting to your project.

Aim to explain/pitch your project to someone that has a good technical
understanding but has strictly no idea of your project and what it does.

## Submission

Your work is due as follow:

- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **17.10.2024 23:59**
- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **20.10.2024 23:59**

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Each day of delay will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the commit hash you
  want to submit

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you do not update the GitHub Discussion with the link to your repository
> and the commit hash before the deadline, it is considered as a late submission
> and you will be penalized.

## Presentations

The practical work presentations will take place in **room B51a** (next to the
stairs) on:

- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **18.10.2024 8:30-10:25**
- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **28.10.2024 8:30-10:25**

We only have **6 minutes per group**. You decide what you want to show us and
how you want to present it.

**Come 5 minutes before your time slot** with your computer. You will have
access to a video projector.

The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next tables:

- [DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings)](#dai-tic-b-monday-mornings)
- [DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings)](#dai-tic-c-friday-mornings)

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!

</details>

## Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?

Can you let us know what was easy and what was difficult for you during this
practical work?

This will help us to improve the course and adapt the content to your needs. If
