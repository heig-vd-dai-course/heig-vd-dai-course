## Objectives

As you have seen in previous chapters, applications communicate with each other
using application protocols.

In this chapter, you will learn how to program your own TCP clients and servers
in Java.

This will allow you to create your own network applications, such as a chat
server, a file server, a web server, etc.

## Explore the code examples

Individually, or in pair/group, **take 10 minutes to explore and discuss the
code examples** provided in the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Clone it or pull the latest changes to get the code examples.

The code examples are located in the `12-java-tcp-programming` directory.

Try to answer the following questions:

- How do the code examples work?
- What are the main takeaways of the code examples?
- What are the main differences between the code examples?

You can use the following theoretical content to help you.

## TCP

TCP is a transport protocol. It is used to transfer data between two
applications.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol: a connection must be established between
the two applications before data can be exchanged in a bidirectional way.

TCP can only do unicast: one application can only communicate with one other
application at the same time.

It is considered as a reliable protocol as data sent is guaranteed to be
received by the other application.

A good analogy is to think of TCP as a phone call: you must first establish a
connection with the other person before you can talk to them. Once the
connection is established, you can talk to the other person and they will hear
everything you say. If they did not hear you well, you can repeat what you said
until they hear you. They can, of course, also talk to you.

TCP is a stream-oriented protocol: data is sent as a stream of bytes. The
application must split the data into segments. Each segment is identified by a
sequence number.

TCP segments are encapsulated in IP packets, called payloads.

Thanks to the sequence numbers, TCP is able to reassemble the segments in the
correct order. If a segment is lost, TCP will retransmit it.

## The Socket API

The Socket API is a Java API that allows you to create TCP clients and servers.
It is described in the
[`java.net` package](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/package-summary.html)
in the
[`java.base` module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html).

It has originally been developed in C in the context of the Unix operating
system by Berkeley University. It has been ported to Java and is now available
on many platform and languages.

To make it simple, a socket is just like a file that you can open, read from,
write to and close. To exchange data, sockets on both sides must be connected.
The processing is the same as with files, seen in the
[Java IOs chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/05-java-ios).

A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.

A socket can act as a client or as a server:

- A socket accepting connections is called a server socket (class
  [`ServerSocket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/ServerSocket.html)).
- A socket initiating a connection is called a client socket (class
  [`Socket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/Socket.html)).

The following schema shows the workflow of a client/server application:

![Client/server application workflow](./images/client-server-workflow.png)

### Client/server common methods

| Operation           | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `socket()`          | Creates a new socket               |
| `getInputStream()`  | Gets the input stream of a socket  |
| `getOutputStream()` | Gets the output stream of a socket |
| `close()`           | Closes a socket                    |

### Client workflow and methods

In order to create a client, the following workflow is followed:

> 1. Create a socket (class `Socket`)
> 2. Connect the socket to an IP address and a port number
> 3. Read and write data from/to the socket
> 4. Flush and close the socket

The available methods are the following:

| Operation   | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect()` | Connects a socket to an IP address and a port number |

### Server structure and methods

In order to create a server, the following workflow is followed:

> 1. Create a socket (class `ServerSocket`)
> 2. Bind the socket to an IP address and a port number
> 3. Listen for incoming connections
> 4. Loop
>    1. Accept an incoming connection - creates a new socket (class `Socket`) on
>       a random port number
>    2. Read and write data from/to the socket
>    3. Flush and close the socket
> 5. Close the socket (`ServerSocket`)

The available methods are the following:

| Operation  | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `bind()`   | Binds a socket to an IP address and a port number |
| `listen()` | Listens for incoming connections                  |
| `accept()` | Accepts an incoming connection                    |

## Processing data from streams

Sockets use data streams to send and receive data, just like files.

You get an input stream to read data from a socket and an output stream to write
data to a socket.

```java
// Get input stream
input = socket.getInputStream();

// Get output stream
output = socket.getOutputStream();
```

You can then decorate the input and output streams with other streams to process
the data, just as with IOs.

```java
// Get input stream as text
input = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

// Get output stream as text
output = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

Use buffered streams to improve performance:

```java
// Get input stream as binary with buffer
input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());

// Get output stream as binary with buffer
output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Do not forget to flush the output stream after writing data to it. Otherwise,
> the remaining data in the buffer will not be sent to the other application!
>
> ```java
> out.flush();
> ```
>
> Also, do not forget all the good practices seen in the
> [Java IOs chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/05-java-ios)
> (encoding, buffering, etc.). They must be applied here too!

### Variable length data

Depending on the application protocol, the data sent can have a variable length.

There are two ways to handle variable length data:

- Use a delimiter
- Use a fixed length

If the data has a delimiter, you can use a buffered reader to read the data
until the delimiter is found.

```java
// End of transmission character
String EOT = "\u0004";

// Read data until the delimiter is found
String line;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(EOT)) {
  System.out.println(
    "[Server] received data from client: " + line
  );
}
```

If the data has a fixed length, you must send the length of the data before
sending the data itself.

```java
// Send the length of the data
out.write("DATA_LENGTH " + data.length() + "\n");

// Send the data
out.write(data);
```

```java
// Read the length of the data
String[] parts = in.readLine().split(" ");
int dataLength = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);

// Read the data
for (int i = 0; i < dataLength; i++) {
  System.out.print((char) in.read());
}
```

## Read-eval-print loop (REPL)

In order to run multiple commands/actions on the server without closing the
connection, you can use what is called a
[read-eval-print loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

To make it simple, a REPL is simply a loop that will ask the user to input
commands. The loop will then execute the command and display the result. The
loop will continue until the user decides to exit the loop.

In the context of a server, the server will wait for the client to send a
command. The server will then execute the command and send the result back to
the client. The server will continue to wait for the client to send a new
command without closing the connection.

On the client side, the client can interact with the server by sending commands
to the server until they decide to close the connection.

Both the client and the server can close the connection at any time. It is up to
the developer to decide when and who manage to close the connection.

## Practical content

### Execute the code examples

Return to the code examples and take some time to execute them, understand them
and see the results.

### Try to access the server from multiple clients at the same time

Try to access the server from multiple clients at the same time (start the
client multiple times). You will see that the server can only handle one client
at a time.

Do you have any idea why? You will find the answer in a future chapter but you
can try to find it by yourself now. Discuss with your peers if needed to share
your findings.

### Update your application protocol

Now that you have gained new knowledge regarding TCP, update the application
protocol you have created for the _"Guess the number"_ game in the
[Define an application protocol chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol)
chapter to reflect the usage of the TCP protocol.

You can check the official solution in the
[Define an application protocol chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol).

### Explore the Java TCP programming template

In this section, you will explore the Java TCP programming template.

This is a simple template that you can use to create your own TCP clients and
servers in Java.

The template is located in the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-java-tcp-programming-template`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-java-tcp-programming-practical-content-template).

Take some time to explore the template. Then, try to answer the following
questions:

- How would you use it to create your own TCP clients and servers?
- What are the main takeaways of the template?
- How you would you implement a TCP network application using the template and
  the provided code examples?

You can use the template to create your own TCP network applications.

### Go further

This is an optional section. Feel free to skip it if you do not have time.

#### Implement the _"Guess the number"_ game

Implement the _"Guess the number"_ game using the application protocol you have
made from the
[Define an application protocol chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol).

You can use the application protocol you have made or the one provided in the
solution if you have not done it.

Use the template and the code examples you just explored to help you implement
the game.

When you create a new repository, you can choose to use a template. Select the
`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-java-tcp-programming-practical-content`
template.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Please make sure that the repository owner is your personal GitHub account and
> not the `heig-vd-dai-course` organization.

#### Dockerize the application

Using the Docker knowledge you have acquired in the
[Docker and Docker Compose chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose),
dockerize the application.

The steps to dockerize the application are the following:

- Create a `Dockerfile` for the application
- Publish the application to GitHub Container Registry

You should then be able to run the server and the client in Docker containers
and access the server from the client using the following commands:

```sh
# Start the server
docker run --rm -it --name the-server <docker-image-tag> server

# Start the client and access the server container
docker run --rm -it <docker-image-tag> client --host the-server
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> I (Ludovic) was not able to test these commands thoroughly. You might need to
> adapt them to make them work. If something does not work, feel free to tell me
> so I can update the commands.

The `--name` sets the name of the container as well as the hostname of the
container. This allows to access the server container using its hostname from
the client.

You might notice that no ports are published to the host. As both container run
on Docker, they share the same network bridge. They can thus communicate
together without passing by the host.

#### Compare your solution with the official one

Compare your solution with the official one stated in the [Solution](#solution)
section.

If you have any questions about the solution, feel free to ask as described in
the [Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?](#finished-was-it-easy-was-it-hard)
section.

#### Go one step further

- Can you update the network application to allow the client to specify the
  range of the number to guess before starting the game?
- Can you implement the "_Temperature monitoring_" application with TCP?

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have learned how to use the Socket API to create your own
TCP clients and servers in Java.

Congratulations! It is a big step forward!

You are now able to create your own network applications, such as a chat server,
a file server, a web server, etc.

As for now, only one client can access the server at the same time. You will see
in a future chapter how to manage multiple clients at the same time!
