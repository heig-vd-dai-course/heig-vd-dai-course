## Objectives

- Program your own TCP client/server applications in Java with the Socket API
- Understand how to process data from streams
- Make usage of a REPL

Your applications will be able to communicate over the network!

## Explore the code examples

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Explore the code examples

Individually, or in pair/group, **take 10 minutes to explore and discuss the
[code examples](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)**.

Answer the questions available in the course material:

- How do the code examples work?
- What are the main takeaways of the code examples?
- What are the main differences between the code examples?

If needed, use the theoretical content to help you.

## TCP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### TCP

TCP is a transport protocol that is similar to a phone call:

1. A connection is established between two parties (unicast)
2. Data sent is guaranteed to arrive in the same order
3. Data can be sent again if needed (retransmission)

## The Socket API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### The Socket API

- Originally developed by Berkeley University
- Ported to Java and many other languages
- Provides a simple API to use TCP and UDP
- A socket is a connection between two parties using a protocol and a port

### Client/server common functions

| Operation           | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `socket()`          | Creates a new socket               |
| `getInputStream()`  | Gets the input stream of a socket  |
| `getOutputStream()` | Gets the output stream of a socket |
| `close()`           | Closes a socket                    |

### Client structure and functions

1. Create a `Socket`
2. Connect the socket to an IP address and a port number
3. Read and write data from/to the socket
4. Flush and close the socket

| Operation   | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect()` | Connects a socket to an IP address and a port number |

### Server structure and functions

1. Create a `ServerSocket`
2. Bind the socket to an IP address and a port number
3. Listen for incoming connections
4. Loop
   1. Accept an incoming connection - creates a new `Socket` on a port
   2. Read and write data from/to the socket
   3. Flush and close the socket
5. Close the `ServerSocket`

---

| Operation  | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `bind()`   | Binds a socket to an IP address and a port number |
| `listen()` | Listens for incoming connections                  |
| `accept()` | Accepts an incoming connection                    |

To make it simple, a socket is just like a file that you can open, read from,
write to and close. To exchange data, sockets on both sides must be connected.

## Processing data from streams

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Processing data from streams

- Sockets use data streams to send and receive data, just like files
- Get an input stream to read data from a socket
- Get an output stream to write data to a socket

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594728613852-cac78bd0daba?fit=crop&h=720)

---

Get the streams from a socket:

```java
// Get input stream
input = socket.getInputStream();

// Get output stream
output = socket.getOutputStream();
```

Read and write data from/to the streams as text:

```java
// Get input stream as text
input = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

// Get output stream as text
output = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

---

Improve performance with a buffer (with a binary stream):

```java
// Get input stream as binary with buffer
input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());

// Get output stream as binary with buffer
output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
```

### Variable length data

Data sent can have a variable length. Manage this using one of the two methods:

- Use a delimiter
- Communicate a fixed length

This must be defined by your application protocol!

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508188317434-1fd219bb636f?fit=crop&h=720)

---

Using a delimiter:

```java
// End of transmission character
String EOT = "\u0004";

// Read data until the delimiter is found
String line;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(EOT)) {
  System.out.println(
    "[Server " + SERVER_ID + "] received data from client: " + line
  );
}
```

---

Communicating a fixed length:

```java
// Send the length of the data
out.write("DATA_LENGTH " + data.length() + "\n");

// Send the data
out.write(data);
```

```java
// Read the length of the data
String[] parts = in.readLine().split(" ");
int dataLength = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);

// Read the data
for (int i = 0; i < dataLength; i++) {
  System.out.print((char) in.read());
}
```

## Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

A REPL is a concept that allows you to interact with a program by sending
commands to it without restarting it.

In networking, it is used to send commands to a server that will read the
commands, evaluate them, and send back the result.

All of this is done in a loop until the client or the server decides to close
the connection.

Useful to keep a connection open and send multiple commands!
