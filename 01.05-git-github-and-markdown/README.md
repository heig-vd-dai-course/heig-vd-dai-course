## Introduction to your first chapter

Welcome to the first chapter of the course!

Each of the chapter of this course will follow quite the same structure:

- A short introduction to the topic with its objectives ;
- A theoretical part to explain the topic ;
- A practical part to apply what you learned ;
- A conclusion part to summarize what you did and learned and to test your
  knowledge ;
- A quick feedback section to let us know if it was easy or hard and how we can
  improve ;
- Additional resources to go further as well as the sources used to create the
  chapter.

This allows you to start with whatever works better for you: the theoretical
followed by the practical, or the practical followed with the theoretical part
in parallel.

While reading the chapters, you might find what is called _"adminitions"_ or
_"alerts"_.

They look like this:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Hey! I'm a note! Glad you read me!

They are here to highlight important information that you should take into
account.

Here are the different types of admonitions you might find and their meaning:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when
> skimming.

> [!TIP]
>
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

We might redirect you to some official documentation or external resources to
follow to set up your environment or to learn more about a specific topic.

These external resources are here to help you. We redirect you to them to avoid
repeating what is already well maintained and explained elsewhere.

We try our best to keep the content as up-to-date as possible. If you find
something that is not up-to-date, do not hesitate to open a discussion, an
issue, a pull request to fix it.

What you see and do in a current chapter might be used in a future chapter.

This is why it is important to follow the steps and to understand what you are
doing. You must keep the code you write, the documentation you create and the
builds you make.

What you see is the result of many hours of work to provide you with the best
content possible. We hope you will enjoy it and learn a lot!

However, if _anything_ is unclear, does not work or needs an improvement, do not
hesitate to ask questions or give feedback in the GitHub Discussions as
described in the
[Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?](#finished-was-it-easy-was-it-hard)
section. Since this is the first chapter, do not hesitate to do so.

The teaching staff considers that there is no stupid question. You are here to
learn and we are here to help you! Let's work as a team so that you can succeed!

Final note: we try our best to provide you working instructions and right
information. However, if something is wrong, we might need to update the content
to fix it. We will inform you but you might need to come back and check the
updated content. We apologize in advance if this situation happens.

Let's get started!

## Objectives

This chapter will help you to understand how Git and GitHub work, how you can
use Markdown to write various documents from documentation to profiles, and how
to use some of the features of Git/GitHub such as GitHub Discussions, the main
place to ask questions in this course.

These skills are essential for the rest of the course (and your future!), as you
will use Git and GitHub to submit your practical works and to collaborate with
your team.

You will also learn how to create your own profile README on GitHub and add
yourself to the GitHub Organization of the course using a common Git workflow.

This is a great way to present yourself and your work to the world! Being part
of the course organization will also allow you to be notified by the teachers
when something important happens through the use of GitHub Teams and GitHub
Discussions.

## Git

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system (VCS)
> designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
> efficiency.
>
> <https://git-scm.com/>

Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel source code, Git
allows to track changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work
among programmers during software development.

### Architecture

Git is a client-server system, where the server is called a **repository** and
the clients are called **clones**.

The repository is the single source of truth, and the clones are the local
copies of the repository.

Git is a **distributed** VCS, which means that each clone is a full copy of the
repository. This allows to work offline.

### Commits, hashes and tags

Git uses **commits** to track changes. A commit is a snapshot of the repository
at a given time. Each commit has a unique identifier, called a **hash**. The
hash is computed from the content of the commit, so it is impossible to modify a
commit without changing its hash.

Commits can be **tagged** to create a reference to a commit. This is often used
to mark a commit as a release.

Commits can be **signed** to prove that the commit was made by a specific
person. This is done for security reasons. It means that the commit was signed
by the author and adds a layer of security to the commit and confidence to the
users of the repository.

### Branches

Git uses **branches** to track different versions of the repository. The default
branch is often called `main` (the legacy name was `master`).

Each branch has a name and a pointer to a commit. The pointer is called a
**head**. The head of the main branch is called `HEAD`.

Often, when implementing a new feature, a new branch is created. This is done by
creating a new branch from the main branch.

Once you made all the changes, the modified files are **staged** and a new
commit is created. The commit is then **pushed** to the repository.

Commits can be compared to see the **differences** between the staged files and
the working directory. This is done by comparing the files with the last commit.

Commits can be **pulled** from the repository into the current branch.

### Merging branches

Collaborating on a project is done by creating branches, making and committing
changes, pushing and merging the branches back into the target branch.

There are three main ways to merge branches:

- **Merge**: merge the changes from the two branches into a new commit. This is
  the default behavior of Git.
- **Rebase**: append the source branch to the target branch so no new commits
  are created. This is a more advanced technique.
- **Squash**: Combine multiple commits into a single one to reduce the number of
  commits in a branch.

### Conflicts

Working collaboratively can lead to **conflicts**. Conflicts happen when two or
more people make changes to the same file at the same time. Git is able to
detect conflicts and will ask the user to resolve them.

### Ignore files

Files can be **ignored** by Git. This is done by creating a `.gitignore` file at
the root of the repository. This allows to avoid committing files that should
not be committed, such as IDE configuration files.

We encourage you **not** to use gitignore generators (such as
<https://gitignore.io/>), as they often add too many files to the ignore list.
It is better to add files to the ignore list as you need it.

We think it is a good practice to ignore all binary files and to only commit
source files. This allows to keep the repository small and to avoid conflicts.

Files can be ignored by name, by extension or by pattern. The syntax is very
similar to the one used in the terminal.

Here is an example of a `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# Ignore all text files inside the repository
*.txt

# Except the input files in the `example` directory
!examples/**/*_input.txt

# Ignore the `target` directory at the root level of the gitignore file but not the others `target` directories
/target/
```

More information about gitignore can be found in the official documentation:
<https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>.

### Summary

- Git is a distributed VCS
- Git uses commits to track changes
- Git uses branches to track different versions of the repository
- Git can pull changes from a branch into another
- Git can merge, rebase or squash branches/commits
- Git can detect and resolve conflicts

We encourage you to learn how to use Git from the command line, so you can still
use it everywhere (even on a server).

### Cheat sheet

```sh
# Clone a Git repository
git clone <url>

# Create a branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Switch to a branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Add changes to the staging area
git add <file>

# View differences between the working directory and the staging area
git diff <file>

# Check Git status
git status

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Push changes to a branch
git push origin <branch-name>

# Pull changes from a branch
git pull origin <branch-name>

# Merge a branch into another
git merge <branch-name>
```

## GitHub

> GitHub is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and
> version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code.
>
> <https://github.com>

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It provides all the
features of Git, plus some additional features.

It is the most popular Git repository hosting service, with more than 372
million repositories (January 2023), a home for many open source projects and a
place where many companies host their private repositories.

### Social platform

GitHub is a **social** platform. It allows to **follow** other users and to
**star** repositories. It also allows to **fork** repositories, which means to
create a copy of a repository in your own account.

### Free features and PRO features

GitHub offers features on top of Git. Some features are only available for
public repositories. To enable them for private repositories, you need to
upgrade to a **PRO** account, which is not free.

As a HEIG-VD student, you can get a **PRO** account for free with the
[GitHub Global Campus for students](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students)
program.

### Users and organizations

Repositories can be owned by a **user** or by an **organization**.

An organization can have multiple members, and repositories can be shared
between members. It is a good practice to create an organization for a project
that will be worked on by multiple people.

### Issues, pull requests and forks

GitHub also provides a **wiki** for each repository, a **project board** to
manage tasks, an **issue tracker** to report bugs and a **pull request** system
to review and merge changes.

Contributing to a project hosted on GitHub is done by **forking** the
repository, making changes and opening a **pull request** to merge the changes
back into the original repository.

Forking is only needed if you are not a member of the repository or
organization.

Once a branch is ready to be merged into the target branch, it is good practice
to open a **pull request** (or a **merge request** on GitLab). A pull request is
a request to merge a branch into another. It is a way to discuss the changes
before merging them.

Reviewing a pull request is done by **commenting** on the changes. The reviewer
can ask for changes to be made before merging the branch or can approve the
changes.

Once the pull request is approved, the branch can be **merged** into the target
branch.

By default, GitHub does not delete the branch once it is merged. You might want
to enable this by default in your repository settings or delete it manually. It
avoids to cumulate out-dated branches in your repository.

### Summary

The whole process would be as follow:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature (optional, but recommended)
2. Clone or fork the project and checkout to a new branch
3. Make your changes, commit and push them as often as you want
4. Create the pull request
5. The maintainers review and merge if OK
6. You can delete the branch or the fork

## Markdown

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a
> plain-text editor.
>
> <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the help of Aaron Swartz
(co-founder of Reddit and an Internet hacktivist). It is a simple markup
language that allows to create formatted text using a plain-text editor.

It is widely used on the Internet, especially on GitHub, and GitLab. It is also
used in many static site generators, such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

### Markdown and output formats

The syntax of Markdown is very simple and easy to learn. It is a good
alternative to HTML for creating simple web pages, documentation, README files,
etc. The extension of a Markdown file is `.md`.

You can export Markdown files to HTML, PDF, DOCX, etc. making it a very
versatile format.

It is also possible to use HTML in Markdown files, so it is possible to create
more complex documents.

In fact, the exact current document you are reading right now is written in
Markdown.

### Syntax

Markdown is a markup language, which means that it uses special characters to
format the text. It is very similar to the syntax used in Discord, Telegram,
WhatsApp, etc.

#### Headings

To create headings, use the `#` character. The number of `#` characters
determines the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5
```

#### Text formatting

Text formatting can be done using `*`, `_`, `~`, `` ` `` or `>` characters.

```markdown
_This is italic_ and _this as well_.

**This is bold** and **this as well**.

This is ~~strikethrough~~.

This is `inline code`.

> This is a quote
```

#### Code blocks

Code blocks can highlight code syntax for many languages. Horizontal rules can
be used to separate sections with `---`.

````markdown
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
````

#### Unordered lists

Unordered lists can be created using `-` or `*` characters.

```markdown
List one

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

List two

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

#### Ordered lists

Ordered lists can be created using numbers followed by a `.` character. Only the
first number matters, the rest can be anything (but it is not recommended for
readability).

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Still item 4
5. Still item 5
```

#### Links

Links can link to local files, headings, or references.

```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com/)

<https://gitlab.com>

[`README.md`](./README.md)

[Jump to "Markdown"](#markdown)

[HEIG-VD][heig-vd]

[heig-vd]: https://heig-vd.ch
```

#### Images

Images can be added using the same syntax as links, but with a `!` character in
front of the link. The text field will be used as the alt text for accessibility
and SEO. An optional title can be set with `""` characters.

```markdown
![](https://my-website.com/assets/logo.png)

![A landscape of the Alps](./images/alps.jpeg)

![A schema describing the Git workflow](./images/schema.svg "Git workflow")
```

#### Tables

Tables can be created using the `|` character to separate columns and `-`
characters to separate the header from the content. The header is optional. The
text alignment can be specified using `:` characters.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | :------: | -------: |
| Cell 1   |  Cell 2  |   Cell 3 |
| Cell 4   |  Cell 5  |   Cell 6 |
```

#### HTML

HTML can be used in Markdown files. This allows to create more complex
documents. It is also possible to use CSS to style the document. This is not
covered in this course and I would not recommend it as the goal of Markdown is
to be simple.

If you have a look at the source code of this document (the Markdown version on
GitHub), you will see that it is written in Markdown and that it uses HTML to
create the slides with the help of [Marp](https://marp.app/).

#### "Hacky" tips

You can use HTML comments to hide content from the Markdown parser. The same can
be achieved using a link-reference.

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment -->

[This is a comment]: #
```

New lines can be added between two lines with two spaces at the end of the line
or by using a backslash at the end of a line.

```markdown
<!-- You might want to highlight these lines to see the double spaces -->

A line  
Another line

A line\
Another line
```

### Specifications

Markdown is not a standard and there are many implementations. The most popular
one is [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/). GitHub uses a slightly different
version called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Some projects use custom extensions to add more features to Markdown. For
example:

- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) uses
  custom extensions to add more features to Markdown.
- [Marp](https://marp.app/) uses a custom syntax to manage background images in
  slides.

### Summary

- Markdown is easy to learn and use
- Markdown can be used to create documentation
- Markdown can be used to create slides
- Markdown can be exported to many formats:
  - For example, the presentations of this course are exported to Web and PDF
    with the help of [Marp](https://marp.app/)
  - For example, the course materials of this course are exported to PDF with
    the help of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and
    [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/)

### Alternatives

_Alternatives are here for general knowledge. No need to learn them._

- [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)
- [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/)
- [Textile](https://textile-lang.com/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) - You might want to consider this if
  you need to write a scientific paper and/or your bachelor/master thesis as it
  is the standard in the scientific community and much more powerful than
  Markdown.

## Practical content

### Create and configure your GitHub account

GitHub is a social platform, home for many open source projects. You will use it
to publish your work and to collaborate with your team. It is a great visibility
tool for your (future) career.

In this section, you will create and configure your GitHub account. If you
already have one, ensure that it is properly configured. Please avoid the use of
GitHub CLI/Desktop or any other application to manage your repositories to be
able to use Git everywhere.

#### Create a GitHub account

If you do not have a GitHub account yet, you will need to create one. We
recommend using your HEIG-VD email address to create your account.

Follow the official documentation to create your account:
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Do not forget to
> [verify your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address)!

#### Enable two-factor authentication (optional, but highly recommended)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. It
will require you to enter a code sent to your phone each time you log in to your
account.

Follow the official documentation to enable two-factor authentication:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa>.

#### Enable your PRO account

Having a PRO account will allow you to unlock all the features of GitHub and
other products, such as Copilot. As a HEIG-VD student, you can get a PRO account
for free.

Follow the official documentation to enable your PRO account:
<https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students>.

### Install and configure Git

Git will be used for the rest of the course to work collaboratively and to
submit your practical work. It is important to have it installed and configured
properly.

In this section, you will install Git on your system. If you already have it,
please check that it is up to date.

#### Install Git

Go to the official website and follow the instructions on how to install Git on
your system: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. As you are using a Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can follow the instructions for Linux (Ubuntu).

#### Check the installation

Open a terminal and type `git --version`.

The output should be similar to this:

```text
git version 2.34.1
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Ensure you have at least version 2.34.0 of Git installed. If you have an older
> version, you might not be able to use some features mentioned in this course.

#### Configure Git

Git needs to know your name and email address to be able to label your commits
properly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Use the same email address you used to create your GitHub account.

Open a terminal and type the following commands:

```sh
# Set your name
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email address
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```

### Enable SSH authentication

SSH is a secure protocol to communicate with a server. It is used to
authenticate users on GitHub. You will learn a bit more about SSH in a future
chapter. For the time being, using SSH with Git will enable you not have to
input your username and password each time you want to push or pull changes from
a repository, contrary to HTTPS.

In this section you will enable SSH authentication on your GitHub account.

#### Generate a SSH key

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow the Linux instructions on the GitHub documentation! By default, the
> Windows instructions are shown if you are on Windows.

Follow the official documentation to generate a SSH key:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Never share your private key with anyone! It must be kept secret and
> confidential, just like a password.
>
> The public key can be shared with anyone. It is used to verify that the
> private key was used to sign a message.
>
> If you ever lose your private key, it can be quite problematic. Have a backup
> of your SSH key pair in a safe place.

#### Add the public SSH key to your GitHub account

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow the Linux instructions on the GitHub documentation! By default, the
> Windows instructions are shown if you are on Windows.

Follow the official documentation to add the public SSH key to your GitHub
account:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>

#### Test the configuration

You can try to clone this very repository using SSH:

```sh
# Clone the course repository using SSH in a directory named "heig-vd-dai-course"
git clone git@github.com:heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course.git "heig-vd-dai-course"
```

If you are able to clone the repository, it means that your SSH key is properly
configured.

The URL of a repository can be found in the **Code** tab of the repository, as
shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot on how to find the SSH URL](./images/github-clone-with-ssh.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> By default, GitHub will show you the HTTPS URL. You need to click on the
> **SSH** tab to see the SSH URL.

Let's switch to a bit of theory now!

### Sign commits with SSH

Signing commits is a good practice to prove that you are the author of a commit.

In this section, you will sign all your commits with SSH (source:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification>).

#### Add a new SSH signing key to your GitHub account

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow the Linux instructions on the GitHub documentation! By default, the
> Windows instructions are shown if you are on Windows.

Follow the official documentation to add a new SSH signing key to your GitHub
account:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>.

> You can use the same public SSH key as the one used to authenticate yourself.
>
> Just add the SSH key as a **signing key**.

#### Tell Git to sign commits with SSH

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow the Linux instructions on the GitHub documentation! By default, the
> Windows instructions are shown if you are on Windows.

Follow the official documentation to tell Git about your SSH key:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-ssh-key>.

#### Enable commit signing in your Git configuration

Git can sign commits on demand or automatically. It is more convenient to sign
commits automatically.

You can enable signing commits automatically by setting the `commit.gpgSign`
configuration to `true`
([source](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)).

```sh
# Enable commit signing
git config --global commit.gpgSign true
```

### Create your own profile README

Let's see how Git works in practice by creating you own profile README on
GitHub.

This will allow you to create your first repository and to learn how to use Git
and GitHub when working on your own projects.

The GitHub profile README is a special repository that will be used to set your
GitHub profile. It is a great way to introduce yourself and to show your
interests.

An example of a profile README is shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot of a profile README](./images/github-profile-benphelps.png)

#### Create a new repository

Follow the official documentation to create a new repository for your profile
README:
<https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme>.

An example of a new repository creation is shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot of a new repository creation](./images/github-new-repository.png)

Once you have created your repository though the GitHub interface, you should
notice it contains a few files. Your repository should be different from the one
shown in the screenshot above.

However, as your repository was initialized with a README file, it already
contains a commit. You can see the commit history by clicking on the "Commits"
link in the repository menu.

You can also see the commit hash (`20f8741`) and the author of the commit
(`ludelafo`), as shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot of a commit in a repository](./images/github-commit-history.png)

If you click on the commit hash, you will see the details of the commit with all
the changes made in the commit.

On the above screenshot, you can see that the commit has the
![Verified badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-green) badge.

If you have signed your commits, you will see the same badge on your commits. It
means that the commit was correctly signed by you.

#### Clone the repository locally

Clone your repository locally.

```sh
# Clone the repository using SSH
git clone YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_README_SSH_URL
```

Using the terminal, navigate to the directory of the repository.

```sh
# Navigate to the repository directory
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

View the list of branches in the repository.

```sh
# View the list of all branches
git branch -a
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/main
```

The `*` indicates the current branch. The `main` branch is the default branch.

The `remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main` and `remotes/origin/main` are remote
branches. The `origin` is the name of the remote repository.

Display the commit history of the repository.

```sh
# View the commit history
git log
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
commit 20f87413aef2fe9ef296767e6db839b722b83532 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Ludovic Delafontaine <ludovic.delafontaine@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 17:28:45 2024 +0200

    Initial commit

```

To quit the log, press `q`.

The commit hash is `20f87413aef2fe9ef296767e6db839b722b83532`. The commit was
made by `Ludovic Delafontaine` on `Tue Jul 23 17:28:45 2024 +0200`.

At the moment, the 20f87413 commit is the HEAD of the main branch, it means that
it is the last commit of the main branch.

#### Fill your profile

Fill the `README.md` file with the content you want to show on your profile
using Markdown using your favorite text editor.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Exceptionally, you can edit the `README.md` file directly through the Windows
> File Explorer by accessing the WSL filesystem. If you have cloned the
> repository without paying attention of the current directory you were in, you
> can find it in the `/home/<user>` directory.

Feel free to be creative! You can add images, links, tables, etc.

Missing inspiration? There are plenty of generators to help you create your
profile README!

#### Commit your changes

Check the changes made to the `README.md` file.

```sh
# Check the changes made to the current branch
git status
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Check the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

```sh
# View the differences between the working directory and the staging area
git diff README.md
```

The output should be similar to this:

```diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 7c46677..76e0528 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
-# new-repository-demo
-A repository to demonstrate the creation of a new repository.
+# How to create a new repository - demonstration
+
+A new line to my README file!
```

The `+` indicates the new line added to the `README.md` file.

The `-` indicates the line removed from the `README.md` file.

Add the `README.md` file to the staging area.:

```sh
# Add the staged files to the staging area
git add README.md
```

Check the staging area.

```sh
# Check the staging area
git status
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
```

If multiple files were modified, you would only see the files that were added to
the staging area in the list of changes to be committed.

Commit the changes with an appropriate message.

> [!TIP]
>
> There is not a clear convention on how to write commit messages. The most
> important thing is to be consistent. We have found using an infinitive verb
> followed by a short description of the changes to be a good practice.

```sh
# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update profile README"
```

Check the log to see the new commit.

```sh
# View the commit history
git log
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
commit 2ea9f1c4d5ef42ee3cf1b0d3849a0445ad8d2683 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Ludovic Delafontaine <ludovic.delafontaine@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 18:33:12 2024 +0200

    Update profile README

commit 20f87413aef2fe9ef296767e6db839b722b83532 (origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Ludovic Delafontaine <ludovic.delafontaine@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 17:28:45 2024 +0200

    Initial commit

```

You can notice that the new commit `2ea9f1c4` is the HEAD of the local `main`
branch.

The `origin/main` and `origin/HEAD` are still pointing to the `20f87413` commit
as their HEAD.

#### Push your changes

Push the changes to the repository:

> [!NOTE]
>
> You might see sometimes the following command `git push origin main`. This is
> just a more explicit way to push the changes to the `main` branch of the
> `origin` remote. `origin` is the default name of the remote when cloning a
> repository.

```sh
# Push the changes to the repository
git push
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 16 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

   20f8741..2ea9f1c  main -> main

```

The output shows that the changes were pushed to the `main` branch of the remote
repository.

#### Check the results

Reload your GitHub profile and check the results. You should see your profile
README!

Check the log to see the history.

```sh
# View the commit history
git log
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
commit 2ea9f1c4d5ef42ee3cf1b0d3849a0445ad8d2683 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

    Initial commit

```

The `2ea9f1c4` commit is now the HEAD of all branches.

#### Share your profile in GitHub Discussions

Share your profile in the GitHub Discussions of this organization:
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions>.

Create a new discussion with the following information:

- **Title**: [DAI 2024-2025] Check out my GitHub profile! - First name Last name
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The link to your GitHub profile README!

This will notify us that you have completed this section and we will check your
profile README!

#### Summary

In this section, you have learned how to create a repository, clone it locally,
make changes, commit them and push them to the repository.

You have also learned how to share your profile README in the GitHub
Discussions.

Feel free to update your profile README as you learn new things!

Feel also free to open any GitHub Discussions to ask questions or to share
interesting content!

The GitHub Discussions are a great way to interact with your peers and to learn
new things. This is where official announcements will be made. You should
receive notifications when a new discussion is created and you are mentioned.

### Add yourself to the list of students in the GitHub organization

In this section, you will add yourself to the list of students in the GitHub
organization README using a workflow we have named the Issue, Fork and Pull
request (PR) workflow. This will allow you to contribute to other projects in
the future.

#### Create a new issue

Create a new issue in the <https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/.github>
repository describing what you want to do:

- **Title**: Add <First name> <Last name> to the list of students (replace
  `<First name> <Last name>` with your information)
- **Description**: I would like to add myself to the list of students in the
  GitHub organization README.

> [!TIP]
>
> While totally optional, it is good practice to create an issue before starting
> to work on any new feature. It allows to discuss the feature with the
> maintainers of the project. Maybe the maintainers have some ideas on how to
> implement the feature or maybe the feature is already planned and you can help
> them! This avoids to waste time on a feature that will not be implemented or
> two people working on the same feature at the same time.

#### Fork the repository

The main repository is protected and you will not be able to push changes
directly to it. You will need to fork the repository and open a pull request.

Fork the repository using the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the
repository page as shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot of the .github repository](./images/github-fork-the-repository.png)

You will be asked to choose where to fork the repository. Choose your own
account. You can change the name of the repository if you want.

#### Clone the repository locally

Forking the repository will create a copy of the repository in your own account.

Clone the repository locally and open it in your favorite text editor.

#### Create a new branch

Create a new branch to add yourself to the list of students:

> [!TIP]
>
> As for the commit messages, there is not a clear convention on how to name
> branches. We have found using an infinitive verb followed by a short
> description of the changes to be a good practice.

```sh
git checkout -b add-myself-to-the-list-of-students
```

Display the branches to see the new branch:

```sh
# View the list of all branches
git branch -a
```

#### Add yourself to the list

Add yourself to the list of students in the `profile/README.md` file. Please add
yourself in alphabetical order (by last name) as mentioned in the HTML comment
in the README file in the class you belong to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> As little as it seems, it is important to respect the alphabetical order. It
> helps us (the teaching staff) searching for someone when grading your work and
> answering your questions. Thanks!
>
> Do not remove the HTML comments in the README file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are on WSL, you can exceptionally edit the `README.md` file directly
> through the Windows File Explorer by accessing the WSL filesystem. If you have
> cloned the repository without paying attention of the current directory you
> were in, you should find it in the `/home/<username>` directory.

```markdown
- First name Last name [@username](https://github.com/<username>)
```

#### Commit your changes

Check the staging area and the differences between the working directory and the
staging area as seen in the previous section.

If you are happy with your changes, commit your changes:

```sh
# Add the staged files to the staging area
git add profile/README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add myself to the list of students"
```

#### Intentionally create a conflict

In the next section, you will intentionally create a conflict to learn how to
resolve it.

Checkout to a new branch and change the title of the `.profile/README.md` file
to `# This change is made on the branch 'this-branch-will-create-a-conflict'`
and commit:

```sh
# Checkout to a new branch
git checkout -b this-branch-will-create-a-conflict

# Make your changes

# Add the staged files to the staging area
git add profile/README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "This change was done on branch 'this-branch-will-create-a-conflict'"
```

Checkout to the branch you created earlier and try to merge the branch you just
created:

```sh
# Checkout to the branch you created earlier
git checkout add-myself-to-the-list-of-students
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You might notice you did not use the `-b` argument when checking out to the
> branch you created earlier. This is because the branch already exists. If you
> try to checkout to a branch that does not exist, you will need to use the `-b`
> argument.

Change the title of the `.profile/README.md` file to
`# This change is made on the branch 'add-myself-to-the-list-of-students'` and
commit the changes:

```sh
# Add the staged files to the staging area
git add profile/README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "This change was done on branch 'add-myself-to-the-list-of-students'"
```

Merge the branch you just created:

```sh
# Merge the branch you just created
git merge this-branch-will-create-a-conflict
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `git merge` will merge the changes from the branch you are merging into the
> current branch. In this case, you are merging the changes from the
> `change-title-of-readme-file` branch into the
> `add-myself-to-the-list-of-students`.

You should see the following error:

```text
Auto-merging profile/README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in profile/README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

#### Resolve the conflict

Git was not able to merge the changes automatically. This is called a **merge
conflict**. This happens when two or more people make changes to the same file
at the same time.

Open the file in your favorite IDE and you should see the conflict.

The `HEAD` part is the content of the current branch. The
`this-branch-will-create-a-conflict` part is the content of the branch you are
trying to merge.

Replace the whole content back to its original state:

```markdown
# HEIG-VD DAI Course
```

Once you are done, add the file to the staging area and commit the changes:

```sh
# Add the staged files to the staging area
git add profile/README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Resolve the merge conflict"
```

Congratulations! You have resolved your first merge conflict!

#### Revert the commits

As this conflict was intentional, you can revert the commits to get back to the
original state of the repository before the intentional conflict.

Check the log to see the history of the repository:

```sh
# Check the log
git log
```

You should see the commits you made:

```text

```

The commit hashes are unique identifiers for each commit. They will, of course,
be different on your screen. They are used to identify a commit. They are also
used to create branches and tags.

As this conflict was intentional, you can revert the commits to get back to the
original state of the repository before the intentional conflict:

```sh
# Revert the commits
git reset --hard 7cfbc3c4d50e353e66cb235b06bf4376e69b3ddb
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> A `git reset --hard` will delete all the changes made since the commit you
> reset to. Be careful when using it! This is OK in this case as the conflict
> was intentional and no commits were pushed to the remote repository. If
> commits were pushed to the remote repository, you would need to use
> `git revert` instead.

#### Get latest changes from the upstream `main` branch

As maintainers might have added new students to the list of students, you will
need to get the latest changes from the upstream `main` branch.

Follow the official documentation to add the upstream remote:
<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork>.

Then, pull the changes from the upstream `main` branch:

```sh
# Check if changes were made to the upstream branch
git fetch upstream
```

Checkout to the local `main` branch:

```sh
# Checkout to the main branch
git checkout main
```

Pull the changes from the upstream `main` branch:

```sh
# Pull the changes from the upstream main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

Checkout to the branch you created earlier:

```sh
# Checkout to the branch you created earlier
git checkout add-myself-to-the-list-of-students
```

Merge the local `main` branch into the branch you created earlier:

```sh
# Merge the main branch into the branch you created earlier
git merge main
```

More information in the official documentation:
<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line>.

#### Push your changes

Push your changes to the repository. This will create a new branch in your
remote repository.

```sh
# Push the changes to the repository
git push --set-upstream origin add-myself-to-the-list-of-students
```

#### Create a pull request

Create a pull request by clicking on the **Contribute** button in your
repository page.

> [!TIP]
>
> If the notification does not appear, you can create a pull request by clicking
> on the **Pull requests** tab and then on the **New pull request** button.
> Select the branches you want to merge and click on the **Create pull request**
> button.

The title of the pull request should be filled automatically with the message of
the last commit. We consider this to be a bad practice. Instead,rename the pull
request to something meaningful. The title of the issue you created earlier is a
good candidate as it describes what you want to do.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You must allow maintainers to update the pull request. This is needed to
> resolve conflicts. If you do not allow maintainers to update the pull request,
> you will need to resolve the conflicts yourself.
>
> Check the **Allow edits by maintainers** checkbox.

Fill the description with `#<number of the issue you created earlier>`,
`Fixes #<number of the issue you created earlier>`, or
`Closes #<number of the issue you created earlier>`. This will automatically
link the issue to the pull request.

Once the description is filled, click on the **Create pull request** button.

You might want to continue to work on the pull request. You can do so by pushing
new commits to the branch. You can also add a comment to the pull request if you
want to discuss something with the maintainers.

> [!TIP]
>
> If your pull request is not ready yet, you can mark it as a draft by clicking
> on the **Mark as draft** button. This will inform the maintainers that the
> pull request is not ready yet and that they should not review it yet. When you
> are ready, you can mark it as ready by clicking on the **Ready for review**
> button.

Once you are ready, mark the pull request as ready.

Add a comment with the usernames of the
[Teaching staff](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course#teaching-staff) team to
let them know that your pull request is ready for review. Add a link to the
issue as well if you did not link it in the description.

#### Wait for review

The maintainers will review your pull request and will ask for changes if
needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The review can take a few day. Please be patient. Come back to this section
> once the review is done. If another chapter is available, you can start it.

They will then add you as a member of the GitHub organization and will add you
to the `[@students](https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/teams/students)`
team.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You might not be able to see the list of students mentioned in the previous
> section. You will be able to see it once you have joined the GitHub
> organization as well as all other teams:
> <https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/teams>.

<details>
<summary>Checklist for the maintainers</summary>

Check the following elements:

- [x] The student is in the list of students
- [x] The student is in alphabetical order
- [x] The GitHub profile is mentioned next to the name of the student
- [x] The issue is linked to the pull request, if not, link it yourself as the
      student do not have the rights to do so
- [x] Add the student to the GitHub organization

If they are conflicts because the students are editing the same lines, fix the
conflict yourself so the students can focus on the content. You can use the
GitHub web interface. Please be aware that GitHub can take some time to update
the changes even though you have resolved the conflict.

If students have submitted their pull request from their `main` branch, review
it but add the following comment on the pull request:

```text
You have submitted the PR from the `main` branch of your fork. In the future, please switch to another branch as [mentioned in the practical content](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/03-git-github-and-markdown/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#create-a-new-branch) so you can always pull changes from the upstream `main` branch (`heig-vd-dai-course:main`) without any conflicts.
```

Add the student to the GitHub organization and the right team.

</details>

#### Make changes if needed

The maintainers might ask for changes. If they do, you will need to make the
changes locally, commit them and push them to the repository.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you need to sign all the previous commits you did, you can use `git log`
> and the following command to sign all the commits after the commit hash
> mentioned ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54987693)):
>
> ```sh
> # Sign all commits after the commit hash
> git rebase --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit -n -S" -i <hash of the previous commit>
>
> # Force push the changes
> git push --force
> ```

#### Accept the invitation

Once the pull request is approved, you will receive an invitation to join the
GitHub organization. Accept the invitation so you are part of the course and we
can notify all the students at the same time using GitHub Discussions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You must accept the invitation to be part of the GitHub organization. If you
> do not accept the invitation, you will not receive notifications from the
> teaching staff when announcements are made.

#### Check the results

Once the pull request is approved and merged, you can check the results on the
organization README. You should see your name in the list of students! You can
now fetch the changes to your local repository.

#### Change the membership visibility of the organization (optional)

If you want, you can change the visibility of your membership in the GitHub
organization. You can choose between public and private.

You can do so by going in the settings of the organization and then in the
**Membership** tab.

This will allow other users to see your membership in the organization. They
will be able to see your username and the date you joined the organization.

This is totally optional. You can keep your membership private if you want.

#### Fetch the changes

Fetch the changes to your local repository:

```sh
# Pull the changes
git fetch
```

Fetching will download the changes from the remote repository without the files.

It will display if new branches have been created or if new commits have been
added to existing branches.

#### Checkout to the main branch

Checkout to the main branch:

```sh
# Checkout to the main branch
git checkout main
```

#### Pull the changes

Pull the upstream changes to your local repository:

```sh
# Pull the changes
git pull upstream main
```

Now files will be downloaded to your local repository. Maybe some of your peers
have added themselves to the list of students!

You are now ready to start the cycle again!

You can optionally delete the branch you created earlier:

```sh
# Delete the branch
git branch -d add-myself-to-the-list-of-students
```

This will delete the branch locally.

#### Delete the fork (optional)

You can delete the fork you created earlier if you want **after the pull request
has been merged to the main repository**.

You can go in the settings of your repository and **General > Danger zone**.
This will not delete the repository in the organization nor the changes you
made.

#### Summary

In this section, you have learned how to open an issue, create an issue, fork a
repository, clone it locally, create a new branch, make changes, commit them,
push them to the repository, create a pull request, wait for review, make
changes if needed and check the results. You have also learned how to fetch and
pull changes from a remote repository.

There are many ways to contribute to a project. This is just one of them that we
find easy to understand and to use.

Feel free to contribute to other projects using this workflow!

You are now ready to work professionally with Git and GitHub!

### Go further

This is an optional section. Feel free to skip it if you do not have time.

- Go in the GitHub Discussions, check the others profiles and follow them! You
  will be able to see their activity on your GitHub feed (what they star, what
  they do, etc.)!
- Can you think of an open source project you like? Give them a star on GitHub!

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have installed and configured Git properly. You have also
created your own GitHub account and profile README for your future social
profile as a computer scientist engineer.

Finally, you have added yourself to the list of students in the GitHub
organization using the issue, fork and pull request workflow, enabling you to
contribute to other projects in the future.

Git is a valuable tool for collaborative work but we only scratched the surface.
Refer to the resources for more useful content!

Using Markdown, you can now write valuable documentation, as any code you write
is meant to be used by other people. Even if you are the only one working on a
project, you will need to understand your own code in a few months or years.

Other people will want to know that is the purpose of your project and how to
use it. A good documentation is a good publicity for your project.

### Test your knowledge

At this point, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- How does Git work?
- What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- How is Markdown different from Word?
- What is a repository? What is a clone?
- What is a tag? How is it different from a commit?
- Describe a typical Git workflow.
