### Sources, streams and sinks of data

- Abstraction of data flow
- Source: where data comes from (input)
- Sink: where data goes to (output)
- Stream: data flows between source and sink

## The Java IO API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### The Java IO API

- Part of `java.base` module
  - `java.io` package
  - `java.nio` package
- Different classes for different IO types:
  - Binary data
  - Text data

![bg right contain](./images/the-java-io-api.png)

## Types of data

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Types of data

- Two types of data:
  - Binary
  - Text
- Both are `0`s and `1`s - the difference is in interpretation:
  - Binary data - raw data
  - Text data - interpretation

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data-vs-text-data.png)

## Processing binary data with the Java IO API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Processing binary data with the Java IO API

- Most basic type of data processing:
  1. Open a file
  2. Read/write/modify the bytes as they are
  3. Close the file

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

### Reading binary data

- Most simple way is to read byte by byte (not efficient)
- `InputStream` and `FileInputStream` classes are used to read binary data
- Let's have a look at the code example `BinaryReadFileExample`

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

```java
class BinaryReadFileExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    InputStream fis = new FileInputStream("binary-file.bin");

    // -1 indicates the end of the file
    int b;
    while ((b = fis.read()) != -1) {
      System.out.print(b);
    }

    fis.close();
  }
}
```

### Writing binary data

- Most simple way is to write byte by byte (not efficient)
- `OutputStream` and `FileOutputStream` classes are used to write binary data
- Let's have a look at the code example `BinaryWriteFileExample`

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

```java
class BinaryWriteFileExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    OutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("binary-file.bin");

    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
      fos.write(i);
    }

    fos.close();
  }
}
```

### Reading and writing binary data with buffers

- Reading and writing byte by byte is not efficient: each `read()` or `write()`
  call results in a system call every time
- Buffers can be used to read write multiple bytes at once

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

Use a buffer to read multiple bytes at once:

1. First time, a system call is made to read a block of data
2. Subsequent reads are done from the buffer
3. When the buffer is empty, a new block is read

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

The same applies for writing:

1. First time, a buffer is created
2. Data is written to the buffer
3. When the buffer is full, a system call is made to write the block
4. The buffer is then emptied
5. Bytes can remain in the buffer
   - A flush might be needed to empty the buffer

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

- `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream` classes are used to
  read/write binary data with buffers
- Let's have a look at the code examples `BinaryBufferReadFileExample` and
  `BinaryBufferWriteFileExample`

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-binary-data.png)

---

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     InputStream fis = new FileInputStream("binary-file.bin");
+    InputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);

     // -1 indicates the end of the file
     int b;
-    while ((b = fis.read()) != -1) {
+    while ((b = bis.read()) != -1) {
       System.out.print(b);
     }

-    fis.close();
+    // Closing the BufferedInputStream automatically closes the FileInputStream
+    bis.close();
   }
```

---

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     OutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("binary-file.bin");
+    OutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos);

     for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
-      fos.write(i);
+      bos.write(i);
     }

-    fos.close();
+    // Flush the buffer to write the remaining bytes
+    bos.flush();
+    bos.close();
   }
```

### A quick note on little endian vs. big endian

- Little endian: least significant byte first
- Big endian: most significant byte first
- Java uses big endian by default
- The class `ByteBuffer` can be used to convert between the two (not covered in
  this course)
- Example: `12345678`
  - Little endian: `0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12`
  - Big endian: `0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78`

## Processing text data with the Java IO API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Processing text data with the Java IO API

- Text data: interpretation of binary data
- Different character encodings
- Different end of line characters
- Different IO classes for text data

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-text-data.png)

### Ancestor of character representations: ASCII

- ASCII: 128 binary values
- Mapping binary to characters
- Published in 1963 and meant for English

![bg right w:90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/USASCII_code_chart.png)

### Extended ASCII: codes pages

- Extended ASCII (code pages)
- Support for more characters using the remaining 128 values

![bg right w:80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Latin-1-infobox.svg)

### Unicode

- Unicode: solves ASCII limitations
- Standard to support all languages
- Different implementations:
  - UTF-8
  - UTF-16
  - UTF-32

![bg right contain](./images/unicode-website.png)

### UTF-8

- UTF-8: variable-length encoding
- Most common Unicode implementation
- ASCII compatible
- Quite the standard for web and software development

![bg right contain](./images/utf-8-wikipedia-article.png)

### What happens if you ignore the character encoding?

- Not stored in the file itself
- Misinterpretation leads to issues
- Check, compile and run the `TextCharacterEncodingsExample` code example!

![bg right:40% w:80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Replacement_character.svg)

### Reading and writing text data

- `Reader` and `Writer` classes are used to read/write text data
- **Always specify the encoding!** If not set, it can be incompatible with other
  systems
- Let's have a look at the code example `TextReadAndWriteFileExample`

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-text-data.png)

---

```java
class TextReadAndWriteFileExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Reader reader = new FileReader("file.java", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    Writer writer = new FileWriter("file.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

    // -1 indicates the end of the file
    int c;
    while ((c = reader.read()) != -1) {
      writer.write(c);
    }

    writer.close();
    reader.close();
  }
}
```

---

- Just like with binary data, reading and writing text data byte by byte is not
  efficient
- `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` classes are used to read/write text data
  with buffers
- Let's have a look at the code example `TextBufferReadAndWriteFileExample`

![bg right:45% w:90%](./images/processing-text-data.png)

---

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     Reader reader = new FileReader("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.java", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
+    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);
+
     Writer writer = new FileWriter("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
+    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(writer);

     // -1 indicates the end of the file
     int c;
-    while ((c = reader.read()) != -1) {
-      writer.write(c);
+    while ((c = br.read()) != -1) {
+      bw.write(c);
     }

-    writer.close();
-    reader.close();
+    // Flush the buffer to write the remaining bytes
+    bw.flush();
+    bw.close();
+    br.close();
   }
```

### End of line characters

- Different end of line characters on different systems
  - Unix/Linux/macOS: `\n`, called _"Line feed"_ (`LF`)
  - Windows: `\r\n`, called _"Carriage Return + Line feed"_ (`CR`+`LF`)

![bg right w:90%](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/02/Notepad-before.png)

---

```java
class TextEndOfLineCharactersExample {

  public static String END_OF_LINE = "\n";

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    InputStream is = new FileInputStream("file.java");
    Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(is, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);

    OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
    Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(os, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(writer);

    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
      // Careful: line does not contain end of line characters
      bw.write(line + END_OF_LINE);
    }

    bw.flush();
    br.close();
    is.close();
  }
}
```

### Dealing with errors

- All kinds of errors can occur when reading/writing files
- Files must be properly opened and closed
- Ensure no files are corrupted
- Two main ways to handle exceptions:
  - `try-catch-finally` blocks
  - `try-with-resources` blocks

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579373903781-fd5c0c30c4cd?fit=crop&h=720)

---

```java
// Bad example: try-catch without finally
public static void tryCatchWithoutFinallyExample() {
  try {
    Reader reader = new FileReader("missing.file");
    Writer writer = new FileWriter("missing.file");

    writer.write(reader.read());
  } catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
  }
}
```

---

```java
// Better example: try-catch with finally
public static void tryCatchFinallyExample() {
  Reader reader = null;
  Writer writer = null;

  try {
    reader = new FileReader("missing.file");
    writer = new FileWriter("missing.file");

    writer.write(reader.read());
  } catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
  } finally {
    if (writer != null) {
      try {
        writer.close();
      } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Exception in close writer: " + e);
      }
    }

    if (reader != null) {
      try {
        reader.close();
      } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Exception in close reader: " + e);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

```java
// Best example: try-with-resources
public static void tryWithResourcesExample() {
  try (Reader reader = new FileReader("missing.file");
      Writer writer = new FileWriter("missing.file")) {
    writer.write(reader.read());
  } catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
  }
}
```
