## Code examples

This directory contains several examples of Java IOs implementations.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

They are ordered by complexity. You should explore them in the following order:

1. [Reading and writing binary data](./01-reading-and-writing-binary-data).
2. [Reading and writing binary data with buffers](./02-reading-and-writing-binary-data-with-buffers).
3. [Character encodings](./03-character-encodings).
4. [Reading and writing text data](./04-reading-and-writing-text-data).
5. [Reading and writing text data with buffers](./05-reading-and-writing-text-data-with-buffers).
6. [End of line characters](./06-end-of-line-characters).
7. [Dealing with errors](./07-dealing-with-errors).

## Usage

To run the examples, you can use the following commands:

```sh
# Compile the example
javac <ExampleName>.java

# Run the example
java <ExampleName>
```
