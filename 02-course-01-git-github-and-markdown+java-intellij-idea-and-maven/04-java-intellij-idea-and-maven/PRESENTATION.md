## Java

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Java

- General-purpose, object-oriented language
- Write once, run anywhere (WORA)
- Created by James Gosling, 1995 at Sun Microsystems
- The documentation seems scary but you will get used to it and it is very
  useful

![bg right h:60%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg)

### Java virtual machine

- Compiles source code to bytecode
- Executes in Java virtual machine (JVM)
- Where a JVM exists, Java can run (most of the time)

![bg right contain](./images/java-api-specification.png)

### JVM versions

- Multiple implementations exist
- Can target different platforms and/or specific features
- JDK for development, JRE for running
- Eclipse Temurin is recommended

![bg right contain](./images/which-version-of-jdk-should-i-use.png)

### Java versions and version managers

- Java 21 is the latest LTS
- You can use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to manage multipe versions of Java
- Match versions for project consistency

![bg right w:80%](https://sdkman.io/assets/img/sdk-man-small-pattern.svg)

### Compiling and running Java programs

- Compile manually with `javac` command

  ```sh
  javac HelloWorld.java
  ```

- Execute with `java` command

  ```sh
  java HelloWorld
  ```

- Modern way: package into JAR files with the help of Maven

  ```sh
  java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.20.1.jar nogui
  ```

### Summary

- Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
- Java is compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by a Java virtual machine
  (JVM).
- Java is intended to be portable, thanks to the JVM.
- Java has various versions, each with its own set of features and improvements.
- Versions managers allow you to install and switch between different versions
  of Java.

## IntelliJ IDEA

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### IntelliJ IDEA

- IDE for (Java) software development
- Developed by JetBrains
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Quite a standard in the industry

![bg right w:60%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/IntelliJ_IDEA_icon.svg)

### Community Edition and Ultimate Edition

- Community (free) and Ultimate (paid)
- Free student license available - you can get it!
- The Community Edition is sufficient for this course

![bg right contain](./images/intellij-community-and-ultimate-edition.png)

### JetBrains Toolbox App

- Manage multiple JetBrains IDEs
- Install and update in one place
- Optional but very useful

![bg right w:60%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/Toolbox_icon.svg)

### Configuration files and Git

- `.idea` directory for project config
- Allow to share project settings between developers
- Some files must be ignored to avoid issue (local config) in Git

![bg right contain](./images/gitignore-example.png)

### Summary

- IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java
  for developing computer software.
- IntelliJ IDEA is available in two editions: the Community Edition (free and
  open-source) and the Ultimate Edition (proprietary).
- You are eligible for a free student license for the Ultimate Edition.
- When creating a new project, IntelliJ IDEA will create a `.idea` directory
  containing the project configuration files.
- Some of these files must be ignored by Git, as they contain local
  configuration that is specific to your computer.

## Maven

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Maven

- Maintained by Apache Software Foundation
- Software project management tool
- Manages dependencies
- Build automation tool
- Allows to define a standard project structure

![bg right w:80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Apache_Maven_logo.svg)

### Maven project structure

- Standardized directory structure
  - `src/main/java`
  - `src/main/resources`
  - `src/test/java`
- Simplifies build process with conventions

![bg right contain](./images/maven-project-structure.png)

### `pom.xml` file

- Configuration and build settings
- Shared among developers
- Defines dependencies and plugins:
  - Plugins extend Maven functionality
  - Dependencies are external libraries

![bg right contain](./images/maven-pom-file.png)

### Maven lifecycle

- Maven defines build process
- Composed of phases and goals
- Phases load plugin goals
- Goals execute tasks on your project (e.g., compile, test, package)

![bg right contain](./images/maven-lifecycle.png)

### Maven Repository

- Public repository of Java libraries
- Maven can download dependencies automatically
- You can publish your own libraries
- Many libraries available such as picocli, a library for building CLI
  applications

![bg right contain](./images/maven-repository.png)

### Maven wrapper

- Allows to use Maven without installing it
- Wrapper script downloads Maven
- Ensures consistent Maven version
- Use `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` instead of `mvn`

![bg right contain](./images/maven-wrapper.png)

### Summary

- Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.
- Maven is a dependency manager for Java projects.
- Maven is a build automation tool for Java projects.
- Maven defines a standard directory structure for Java projects.
- Maven defines a standard build process for Java projects.
- The `pom.xml` file contains the configuration of your Maven project.
