## Electronic messaging protocols: SMTP, POP3 and IMAP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Electronic messaging protocols: SMTP, POP3 and IMAP

- Email clients are called **Mail User Agents (MUA)**
- Email servers are called **Mail Transfer Agents (MTA)**
- They use different protocols to communicate

![bg right:40% h:90%](https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/05/1024x1024@2x.png)
![bg vertical right:40% h:70%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Microsoft_Exchange_%282019-present%29.svg)

### SMTP

- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- Uses TCP port 25 (unencrypted) or 465 (encrypted)
- Used to send emails

![bg right contain](./images/smtp.png)

### POP3

- POP3: Post Office Protocol
- Uses TCP port 110 (unencrypted) or 995 (encrypted)
- Used to retrieve emails from a server

![bg right contain](./images/pop3.png)

### IMAP

- IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol
- Uses TCP port 143 (unencrypted) or 993 (encrypted)
- Used to retrieve emails from a server
- Much more powerful than POP3 (synchronization, ...)

## DNS records related to email

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### DNS records related to email

- `MX`: Mail eXchange - Specifies the mail server responsible for a domain name
- `TXT`: Store any text-based information. Used for `SPF` records, for email
  authentication

## Security concerns and spam

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Security concerns and spam

- SMTP is old and insecure
- Easy to spoof and forge emails
- Hard to maintain
- ➡️ Your email server can be used for spam and can be blocked
- ➡️ We will use a mock server to simulate an email server

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1617440168937-c6497eaa8db5?fit=crop&h=720)

## A focus on the SMTP protocol

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### A focus on the SMTP protocol

- SMTP is a text-based protocol
- Messages are sent by the client to the server
- The server responds with a status code
- The client can send the next command

![bg right contain](./images/a-focus-on-the-smtp-protocol-1.png)

---

- `HELO` /`EHLO`
- `MAIL FROM`
- `RCPT TO`
- `DATA`
  - `Subject:`
  - `From:`
  - `To:`
  - End by `.`
- `QUIT`
