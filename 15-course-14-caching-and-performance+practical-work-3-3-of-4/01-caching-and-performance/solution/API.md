# Users API

The users API allows to manage users. It uses the HTTP protocol on port `8080`.

The JSON format is used to exchange data. The `Content-Type` header must be set
to `application/json` when sending data to the API. The `Accept` header must be
set to `application/json` when receiving data from the API.

The API is based on the CRUD pattern. It has the following operations:

- Create a new user
- Get many users that you can filter by first name and/or last name
- Get one user by its ID
- Update a user
- Delete a user

Users are also able to login and logout. They can also access their profile to
validate their information using a cookie.
