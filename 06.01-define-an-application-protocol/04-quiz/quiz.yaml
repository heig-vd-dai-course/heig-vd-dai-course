        Define the set of rules that governs the communication between two or more systems.

        Usually defined in a Request For Comments (RFC) document, application protocols are hard to read and understand.

        However, they are the only way to ensure that two systems can communicate with each other in a documented and predictable way.
  - title: What structure does an application protocol have?
    possibleAnswers:
      - A header, a footer, and a body that define a document that can be read on Word
      - A context (overview), the transport protocol(s), the messages exchanged between the systems, and some examples
    correctAnswer:

      explanation: |
        A context (overview), the transport protocol(s), the messages exchanged between the systems, and some examples

        The context (overview) explains the purpose of the application protocol.

        The transport protocol(s) define the protocol(s) used to transport the messages between the systems and how communication is established between the systems.

        The messages exchanged between the systems define the structure of the messages exchanged between the systems.

        The examples show how the messages are exchanged between the systems.
