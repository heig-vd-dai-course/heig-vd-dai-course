## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files.
- Practice Java IOs.
- Practice Java, Maven and [picocli](https://picocli.info/).
- Practice a Git workflow to share your work with your team.
- You can choose what the CLI will do (you can be creative! - manipulate text,
  images, audio, cryptographic transformations, etc. for example).

## Demo

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### Compile and run the CLI

Compile the project:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Run the CLI without any arguments:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Run the CLI (1/2)

```text
Missing required options: '--input=<inputFile>', '--output=<outputFile>'
Usage: practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [-hV] -i=<inputFile>
       [-I=<inputEncoding>] -o=<outputFile> [-O=<outputEncoding>] [COMMAND]
Process an input file and return a result.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -i, --input=<inputFile>   The input file.
  -I, --input-encoding=<inputEncoding>
                            The input file encoding (default: UTF-8).
  -o, --output=<outputFile> The output file.
  -O, --output-encoding=<outputEncoding>
                            The output file encoding (default: UTF-8).
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
```

---

```text
Commands:
  uppercase  Converts the input file to uppercase.
  lowercase  Converts the input file to lowercase.
```

Run the CLI with the `uppercase` command:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --input input.txt \
  --output output.txt \
  uppercase
```

### Run the CLI (2/2)

You can also specify the encoding of the input and output files:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --input input.txt --input-encoding UTF-8 \
  --output output.txt --output-encoding US-ASCII \
  uppercase
```

### See the results

Input file:

```text
$ cat input.txt
Bonjour, comment ça va aujourd'hui ?
```

Output file:

```text
$ cat output.txt
BONJOUR, COMMENT ?A VA AUJOURD'HUI ?
```

Why is the `ç` not converted to uppercase?

## Group composition

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### Group composition

- Two (2) or three (3) students per group.
- Create a GitHub Discussion to:
  - Announce your group members.
  - Announce your idea (even a draft is fine).
- **You must do it before next week**, otherwise you will be penalized (check
  the [Constraints](#constraints) for details).

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491911923017-19f90d8d7f83?fit=crop&h=720)

## Idea validation

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### Idea validation

- You must state your idea on your GitHub Discussion.
- We might ask you to change your idea if it is too simple or too complex.
- We will help you to find a good idea if needed.
- **You must do it before next week!**

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543075137-5a97903aaa7a?fit=crop&h=720)

## Grading criteria

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### Grading criteria

Based on 25 criteria and a three-point scale:

- **0 point** - The work is missing, off-topic, or shows a very limited
  understanding of the subject.
- **0.1 point** - The work shows partial understanding: some key elements are
  missing, unclear, or poorly implemented.
- **0.2 point** - The work is complete, accurate, and shows a clear and thorough
  understanding of the subject.

Maximum grade: 25 criteria \* 0.2 + 1 = 6.

## Constraints

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### Constraints (1/3)

- The whole team must contribute to the project and all members must be able to
  explain it in details if asked.
- A GitHub Discussion must be opened during the first week of the project to
  explain the idea of the project so the teachers can validate the idea.
- The GitHub Discussion must be updated with the link to the repository and a
  related commit hash before the deadline - every 24 hours after the deadline
  will result in a -1 point penalty on the final grade.

### Constraints (2/3)

- The application must use Java classes seen in the course to process the files
  (you can use other libraries to help you once the files are opened) - See the
  [External dependencies](#external-dependencies) section.
- The application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word _slightly_, no
  need to shoot for the moon).

### Constraints (3/3)

- You must state your sources if you have used elements that you are not the
  author (code from the Internet, code generated from AI tools, etc.). You must
  also state for which usage you did use the source(s)/tool(s) in your README.
  If you plagiarize the code of another group, you will receive a penalty of 1
  point on the final grade for all groups involved.

Failure to comply with these constraints may result in serious penalties, up to
-1 point penalty on the final grade _**for each criterion not met**_.

## Submission

<!-- _class: lead -->

<!-- (Un)comment the following lines to hide/show the note about the presentations -->

### Presentations (2/2)

We only have **8 minutes per group**. You decide what you want to show us and
how you want to present it. **Come 5 minutes before your time slot** with your
computer. You will have access to a video projector.

The presentation order is random and is stated in the next tables:

- [DAI-TIC-C (Wednesday mornings)](<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/02.02-practical-work-1-(1-of-5)/01-course-material/README.md#dai-tic-c-wednesday-mornings>)
- [DAI-TIC-B (Wednesday afternoons)](<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/02.02-practical-work-1-(1-of-5)/01-course-material/README.md#dai-tic-b-wednesday-afternoons>)
- [DAI-TIC-A (Thursdays)](<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/02.02-practical-work-1-(1-of-5)/01-course-material/README.md#dai-tic-a-thursdays>)

<!-- (Un)comment the following lines to hide/show the note about the presentations -->

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!

## Tips

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course].

### The UNIX philosophy and the KISS principle (1/2)

A set of software design principles that emphasize simplicity, modularity, and
the use of small, single-purpose programs:

> - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> - Write programs to work together.
> - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal
>   interface.

The KISS principle stands for _"Keep It Simple, Silly"_.

### The UNIX philosophy and the KISS principle (2/2)

- Do not try to do too much.
- Focus on the essentials.
- Do it well.

Do not be Numérobis from the movie _Astérix et Obélix : Mission Cléopâtre_!

![bg right:39%](./images/asterix-et-obelix-mission-cleopatre-porte-au-plafond.png)

### External dependencies

- You can use any external librairies you want in your Maven project
- You must explain why and how you use it in your README
- **You cannot use some external libraries to open/close the files**

![bg right w:80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Apache_Maven_logo.svg)

### Add members to the repository

- Add your team members to your repository as collaborators
- This allows them to push directly to the repository
- **If your project is private, do not forget to add the teaching staff!**

![bg right w:60%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg)

### Protect your main branch

- GitHub allows to protect the main branch:
  - Force pull requests
  - Force code review
  - Force signed commits
- This is a good practice to guarantee quality

![bg right w:60%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg)

### How and what to present

You are free to present your work as you want. You can use slides, poster, a
small theater piece, etc. However:

- No need to remind us the objectives (we know them).
- No need to present us the code if not relevant (we will grade it later - OK if
  interesting, complex, or tricky (= relevant)).
- Focus your presentation on the _"what"_ and the _"why"_.

Aim to explain/pitch your project to someone that has a good technical
understanding but who has no idea about your project.
