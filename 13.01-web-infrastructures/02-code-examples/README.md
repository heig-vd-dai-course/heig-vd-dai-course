## Code examples

This directory contains several examples of web infrastructures.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

They are ordered by complexity. You should explore them in the following order:

1. [whoami on ports 80 and 443](./01-whoami-on-ports-80-and-443)
2. [Traefik](./02-traefik)
3. [whoami with host-based routing](./03-whoami-with-host-based-routing)
4. [whoami with host-based and path-based routing](./04-whoami-with-host-based-and-path-based-routing)
5. [whoami with host-based routing and sticky sessions](./05-whoami-with-host-based-routing-and-sticky-sessions)

Optional: [Traefik with DNS challenge](./99-traefik-with-dns-challenge)
