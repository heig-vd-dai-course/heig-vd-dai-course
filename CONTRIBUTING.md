# HEIG-VD DAI Course - Contribution guide

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with its
  [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) plugin must be installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Clone and open the project

1. Clone or fork the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Visual Studio Code should prompt you to install the recommended extension
   ([Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)).
   Install it. Other extensions will be installed automatically when you open
   the project in a Development Container.
4. Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` to open the command palette and run the
   `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` command.
5. Visual Studio Code will build the Docker image and open the project in a
   container with all the required tools installed (extensions and packages).
6. Open the Markdown files in Visual Studio Code and press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V` to
   preview the files.
7. You are now ready to edit the Markdown files and commit your changes.

## Make changes to the Git repository

1. Open an issue describing the changes you want to make.
2. Clone/fork the GitHub repository.
3. Open the project in a container with the help of Visual Studio Code as
   described above.
4. Create a new branch with the name of the issue you want to fix.
5. Edit the files and commit your changes:
   - Ensure all PNGs are optimized with the `optipng *.png` command.
   - Ensure all JPGs are optimized the `jpegoptim *.jpg` command.
   - Ensure all PDFs are optimized with the help of the
     `ps2pdf <input>.pdf <output>.pdf` command.
6. Push and open a pull request.
7. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and merged.

## Tips and tricks

### PlantUML local server

To generate diagrams, you can use the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) local
server.

A local server is automatically available when using the Development Container
at the following address: <http://localhost:9090/>.

### Taking screenshots

All window screenshots are taken with the `Screenshot.app` tool from Apple. You
can open it with the `Command + Shift + 5` shortcut. **Show floating thumbnail**
is enabled in the options.

All application windows are of the same size (888x888) and are placed on the
screen of the Mac Book Pro.

#### Safari

To set Safari to a specific size and position, you can use the following
AppleScript:

```applescript
set theApp to "Safari"
set appPosition to {-1445, 98}
set appSize to {888, 888}

tell application "System Events" to tell application process theApp
	tell window 1
		set position to appPosition
		set size to appSize
	end tell
end tell
```

As I (Ludovic) do not use Safari as my main browser, it is perfect for
screenshots as it does not contain any personal information and/or bookmarks and
extensions.

#### Terminal

To set Terminal to a specific size and position, you can use the following
AppleScript:

```applescript
set theApp to "Terminal"
set appPosition to {-1445, 98}
set appSize to {888, 888}

tell application "System Events" to tell application process theApp
	tell window 1
		set position to appPosition
		set size to appSize
	end tell
end tell
```
