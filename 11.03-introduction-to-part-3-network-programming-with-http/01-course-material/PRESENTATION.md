## Up until now, you have mostly worked with low-level protocols such as TCP and UDP

<!-- _class: lead -->

These protocols are the foundation of the Internet and network communications.

Today, you will learn about a higher-level protocol: HTTP.

## What will you learn?

- Learn **how** and **why HTTP is used widely** to **build web applications**
- Learn how to use **HTTP in Java** to build simple (CRUD) **APIs**
- Learn how to **set up a web infrastructure** to host web applications:
  - **Reverse proxy**
  - **Load balancer**

## What will you accomplish?

- Build **a simple web API** in Java
- **Acquire**, **configure** and **set up a server**
- **Acquire** a (free) **domain name**
- **Deploy** a web application on the server with a **reverse proxy**
- **Access** the web application from the **Internet**

## Closing the loop

<!-- _class: lead -->

This part will be the last one of the course. This is the last step to close the
loop (from code to production).
