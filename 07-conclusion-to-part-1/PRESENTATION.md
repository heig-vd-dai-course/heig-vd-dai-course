## Evaluation

You might be asked questions about the theoretical content, the practical
content and the practical work.

We might ask you to analyze or code a small program to solve a problem, describe
a schema and/or explain a concept.

All typical questions are at the end of each chapter you studied.

The evaluation will be done on the computer. You will have to be connected to
the
[VPN](https://intranet.heig-vd.ch/services/informatique/poste-de-travail/reseau/vpn/Pages/vpn.aspx).
It is **mandatory**.

---

You can have access to the course material (theoretical and practical content,
as well as practical work) and the
[official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/).

No communication between students is allowed.

ChatGPT, Copilot or any other AI assisted tools are not allowed during the
evaluation.

Cheating is not allowed. If you are caught cheating, you will get a 1 for the
evaluation.

All previous evaluations are available in the
[`archives`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/00-evaluation-and-exam-archives)
folder of the course repository.

## Questions

<!-- _class: lead -->

Do you have any questions?

## Practical work review

The practical work review will start at the end of this presentation.

We only have **5 minutes per group**. Please be prepared to present your work.

The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next slides.

Do not worry, it is not an exam, it is just a way for us to see how you
understood the practical work. 🙂
