## Objectives

- Define and implement a network application with TCP and/or UDP
- Package, publish and run a network application with Docker
- You can choose what the network application will do (you can be creative!)
  - a chat application, a chess game, a shopping list application, ...

## Demo 1

<!-- _class: lead -->

A simple file transfer application made with TCP

![bg opacity:0.1](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610633389918-7d5b62977dc3?fit=crop&h=720)

---

Compile the project:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Run the CLI without any arguments:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-2-demo-1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```text
Missing required subcommand
Usage: DaiFileTransfer [COMMAND]
A simple file transfer application
Commands:
  server  Start a TCP server to serve files
  client  Start a client to download files from a server
```

---

Start the server:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-2-demo-1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server -p 12345 -t 4
```

Start the client:

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-2-demo-1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar client -p 12345
```

---

```text
  _____          _____   _____           _                  _
 |  __ \   /\   |_   _| |  __ \         | |                | |

 |_____/_/    \_\_____| |_|   |_|  \___/ \__\___/ \___\___/|_|

You are connected to server on port 12345 with IP address localhost.

Available commands:
LS - list available files on server
GET <file> - get file from server
QUIT - quit the client
>
```

---

List available files:

```text
> ls
Available files on server:
demo.txt
my-passwords-in-clear.txt
rzr-sc2.exe
```

Get one of the available files:

```text
> GET my-passwords-in-clear.txt
Downloading file from server...
File saved to my-passwords-in-clear.txt
```

---

Get a file that does not exist:

```text
> GET not-found.txt
The specified file was not found on the server.
```

Quit:

```text
> QUIT
Bye.
```

If a client tries to connect to the server when no thread is available, the
client has to wait to be served.

```

Output:

```text

## Group composition

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Group composition

- 2 or 3 students per group
- Create a GitHub Discussion to:
  - Announce your group members
  - Announce your idea (even a draft is fine)
- **Do it as soon as possible before next week!**
  - This helps us to plan the presentations

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491911923017-19f90d8d7f83?fit=crop&h=720)

## Idea validation

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Idea validation

- You must state your idea on your GitHub Discussion
- We might ask you to change your idea if it is too simple or too complex
- We will help you to find a good idea if needed
- **Do it as soon as possible before next week!**

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543075137-5a97903aaa7a?fit=crop&h=720)

## Grading criteria

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Grading criteria

You can find all the grading criteria in the [course material][course-material]:

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

### Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)

## Tips

### Extract the command and parameters from the message

The Short Message Service (SMS) protocol presented in the
[_"Define an application protocol"_](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol)
chapter (accessible in the
[examples repository](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository) defines the following message:

```text
RECEIVE <message> <username>
```

This message is sent by the server to a client to inform them that they have
received a message from another user.

---

The command is `RECEIVE` and the parameters are `<message>` and `<username>`.

The message can be up to 100 characters long.

You can use the following snippet of code to extract the command and the
parameters from the message:

---

```java
List<String> messageParts = Arrays.asList(emitterMessage.split(" ", 2));

String command = messageParts.get(0);
switch (command) {
  // Other cases can be defined here...
  case "RECEIVE" -> {
    if (messageParts.size() < 2) {
      // Invalid message, do something about it such as logging it or returning an error...
    }

    List<String> parameters = Arrays.asList(messageParts.get(1).split(" "));

    if (parameters.size() < 2) {
      // Invalid message, do something about it such as logging it or returning an error...
    }

    String user = parameters.removeLast();
    String message = String.join(" ", parameters);

    System.out.printf("Message from %s: %s\n", user, message);
  }
  // Other cases can be defined here...
}
```

### The POSIX standard

> The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard is a family of
> standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility
> between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system and user-level
> application programming interfaces (APIs), along with command line shells and
> utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of
> Unix and other operating systems.
