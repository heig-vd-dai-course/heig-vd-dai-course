# Practical work 2

<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course>

[Markdown][markdown] · [PDF][pdf]

L. Delafontaine and H. Louis, with the help of Copilot.

Network applications are everywhere. They are used to communicate, to play
games, to watch videos, to listen to music, to browse the web, to send emails,
etc.

In this practical work, you will create a network application that uses the TCP
protocol.

The network application will be defined by an application protocol, a client and
a server. The client will send a request to the server and the server will send
a response to the client.

The application protocol will be defined by you. You can decide to create your
own little application protocol or you can implement an existing protocol.

Feel free to be creative! For example, you can choose to create a chat
application, a game, a file transfer application, etc. If you do not have any
idea, come to see us and we can give you.

Multiple groups can choose the same application protocol and you can share your
methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Define a network application protocol
- Use Java TCP programming to implement a client and a server application

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one or you can work alone if you prefer.
Working alone will not give you any bonus points.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is not done
- 0.1 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.2 point - The work is done

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

### Category 1 - Git, GitHub and Markdown

If your repository is private, you must add us as collaborators to your
repository!

| #   | Criterion                                                        | Points |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| 1   | The entire team contributes to the project and can explain it    |    0.2 |
| 2   | The README is well structured and explains what the CLI is for   |    0.2 |
| 3   | The README explains how to build the CLI                         |    0.2 |
| 4   | The README explains how to use the CLI with examples and outputs |    0.2 |

### Category 2 - Java, IntelliJ IDEA and Maven

| 25  | The answers to the questions are correct          |    0.2 |

## Constraints

- The network application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 17
- The network application must be built using Maven

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your solution is too complex, we might penalize you.

If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might penalize
you.

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project. You must
however explain why and how you use it in your README.

## Submission

The planning of the course is available at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects>. The **deadline** is just
**before the Practical work review and feedback session**.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - Practical work 2 - @member1 and @member2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the latest commit hash
  of your work before submission

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!

## Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?

Can you let us know what was easy and what was difficult for you during this
practical work?

This will help us to improve the course and adapt the content to your needs. If
we notice some difficulties, we will come back to you to help you.
