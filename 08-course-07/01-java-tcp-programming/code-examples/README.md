# Java TCP programming

_Some of these examples are based on the original course by O. Liechti and J.
Ehrensberger._

This repository contains several examples of TCP client/server applications.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

They are ordered by complexity. You should explore them in the following order:

- [Binary client/server](./01-binary-client-server)
- [Textual client/server](./02-textual-client-server)
- [REPL client/server](./03-repl-client-server)

Please be aware that some examples require to be run in a specific order (the
server before the client for example).

## Usage

To run the examples, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the example
javac <ExampleName>.java

# Run the example
java <ExampleName>
```
