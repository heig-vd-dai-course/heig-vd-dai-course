#### Key points to remember for this chapter

- Setting up a professional development environment can really help you be more
  efficient
- You have gained valuable Linux experience using WSL
- For us, the usage of WSL was really positive:
  - Less bugs/edge-cases
  - Easy access to UNIX tools
- While not always easy to setup, you did very well to use it efficiently

#### Elements to improve for next year

- Nothing much to improve in our opinion. Do you agree?

We would like to push these recommandations/tools in the very first weeks of
your studies so you can use these tools from the beginning and in all courses.
We will see if it is possible.

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

0. Set up your Git environment with SSH and signed commits
1. Open an issue to discuss the feature (written in Markdown)
2. Clone or fork the project with SSH and checkout to a new branch
3. Make your changes, commit and push them as often as you want
4. Resolve conflicts if any
5. Create the pull request and add details if needed
6. Other members review and approve if everything is OK
7. The work is merged and you can delete the branch or the fork

##### Elements to improve for next year

- Add tips to validate the configuration of Git using the `~/.gitconfig` file
- Simplify the process of adding students to the GitHub organization:
  - Students open an issue
  - We add them to the GitHub organization and the right team
  - They create a pull request to add themselves to the list of students and we
    merge if everything is OK
- Move the forking process to the "_"Go further"_ section

#### Java, IntelliJ IDEA and Maven

![bg opacity:0.1](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/04-java-intellij-idea-and-maven/images/main-illustration.jpg?raw=true)

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

- Java and the JVM
- Maven as a build tool
  - `pom.xml` file
  - Plugins vs. dependencies
- Sharing code with Git and GitHub
  - `.gitignore` files
  - IntelliJ IDEA (and IDEs in general) configuration files
- Managing multiple versions of Java/dependencies with SDKMAN!

##### Elements to improve for next year

- Add a note regarding memory management with Java (garbage collector, etc.)
- Make students install older LTS versions instead of newer, non-LTS versions so
  they don't pollute their computer with unnecessary Java versions
- More details on how picocli works maybe?

#### Java IOs

![bg opacity:0.1](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/05-java-ios/images/main-illustration.jpg?raw=true)

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

- Java IOs classes and use cases (text files vs. binary files)
- Those ðŸ¤¬ charset encodings (Unicode vs. UTF-8 vs. other charsets)
- Buffering and flushing
- End of line characters (`\n`, `\r`, `\r\n`, etc.)
- Dealing with exceptions (try-with-resources, etc.)

You **should always specify encodings and end of line characters explicitly** as
the defaults are dependent on the platform your code is running on. Marking them
explicitly will make your code **portable**.

##### Elements to improve for next year

- Nothing much to improve in our opinion. Do you agree?

#### Docker and Docker Compose

#### Define an application protocol

<!--
_class: lead

-->

[Find this chapter on GitHub](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/11-define-an-application-protocol)

![bg opacity:0.1](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/11-define-an-application-protocol/images/main-illustration.jpg?raw=true)

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

Defining an application protocol is **not an easy task**. There are many ways to
do it, and there is no "one size fits all" solution. You should always keep in
mind the following points:

1. Context - What the application protocol is used for?
2. Transport - What protocol(s) is/are involved? On which port(s)? How are
   messages/actions encoded? How are messages/actions delimited? How are
   messages/actions treated? Who initiates/closes the communication? What
   happens on an unknown message/action/exception?

---

3. Messages/actions - What are the messages/actions? What are the parameters?
   What are the return values? What are the exceptions?

   Always try to describe these **for a given context**, not from each point of
   view (e.g. "_making an order_" with the input/outputs from the client to the
   server and the responses instead of "_the client sends these messages and the
   server replies these messages with these outputs_"). It makes it _way_ easier
   to understand and to implement.

4. Example diagrams - What are the examples of messages/actions? What are the
   examples of exceptions? Illustrate your application protocol with diagrams to
   make it easier to understand.

##### Elements to improve for next year

- Nothing much to improve in our opinion. Do you agree?

#### Java TCP programming

<!--

![bg opacity:0.1](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/12-java-tcp-programming/images/main-illustration.jpg?raw=true)

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

- TCP as a reliable protocol
- TCP is unicast only
- A client and a server communicate using `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes on
  a given port for a given host
- Dealing with sockets' streams are the same as with files: buffering, flushing,
  charsets, end of line characters, exceptions handling, etc.

##### Elements to improve for next year

- Nothing much to improve in our opinion. Do you agree?

#### Java UDP programming

<!--
_class: lead

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

- Differences between TCP and UDP
- Reliability of UDP
- Unicast, broadcast and multicast
- A client/server (unicast) and or emitter/receiver (multicast) communicate with
  the `DatagramSocket`, `DatagramPacket` and `MulticastSocket` classes

![bg opacity:0.1](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/14-java-network-concurrency/images/main-illustration.jpg?raw=true)

##### Key points to remember for this chapter

- Concurrency allows to manage multiple task simultaneously
- Java offers classes and data structures to manage concurrency
- Multiple strategies exist to manage concurrency, with different trade-offs:
  - Unlimited threads can use all the available resources
  - Threadpools can set the maximum number of threads but need to calculate the
    right amount to use resources efficiently
  - Recommended: Threadpools for Java < 19 and VirtualThreads for Java > 19
