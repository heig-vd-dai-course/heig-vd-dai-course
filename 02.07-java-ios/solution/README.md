## Benchmark results

These benchmark were done on a laptop with the following specifications:

- **Processor**: AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 7 7840U
- **Memory**: Kingston FURY Impact 2 x 16GB DDR5 (5600MHz, CL40)
- **Storage**: SOLIDIGM P44 Pro SSD M.2 2.0TB (read: 7 GB/s, write: 6.5 GB/s)
- **Operating System**: Fedora 39 (Linux 6.9.12-100.fc39.x86_64)

Each benchmark was run 10 times, and the average time was calculated with the
help of the `run_benchmarks.sh` script.

## Answers to the questions

### Which type of stream is the most efficient for each use case?

- For binary data, the most efficient stream is the `BufferedInputStream` and
  `BufferedOutputStream`.
- For text data, the most efficient stream is the `BufferedReader` and
  `BufferedWriter`.

Even though for small files, the difference is negligible, for large files, the
buffered streams are way more efficient.

We always recommend using the buffered streams because they are more efficient
and provide better performance even for small files.

### Why is it more efficient than the other types of streams?

- The `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream` use a buffer to read and
  write data. This buffer reduces the number of system calls, which is more
  efficient.

### What is the difference between binary data and text data?

The binary data is a sequence of bytes, while the text data is a sequence of
characters.

When dealing with text data, we need to consider the character encoding. The
character encoding is a mapping between characters and bytes. The most common
character encoding is UTF-8.

### What is a character encoding?

A character encoding is a mapping between characters and bytes. The character
encoding defines how characters are represented as bytes.

### Why is this benchmark methodology important?

> This methodology is important because it provides a structured and systematic
> approach to solving problens or conducting research, ensuring consistency,
> reliability, and the ability to replicate results.
