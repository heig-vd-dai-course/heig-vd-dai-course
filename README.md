Welcome to the
[D√©veloppement d'applications internet (DAI)](https://gaps.heig-vd.ch/consultation/fiches/uv/uv.php?id=6573)
teaching unit taught at
[Haute Ecole d'Ing√©nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD)](https://heig-vd.ch),
Switzerland!

## üéØ General objectives

On completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Understand the principles of network communication and how to program
  efficient network applications.
- Use Java, Maven and Git/GitHub to develop network applications.
- Define, implement and interact with various network applications using TCP,
  UDP and HTTP protocols.
- Deploy network applications in a containerized environment with Docker and
  Docker Compose on a web infrastructure (servers, reverse proxies, caching,
  etc.).

Thanks to these skills, the student will be able to develop efficient and robust
applications that can communicate over the network (for example, business
applications, APIs, games, etc.).

## üìÖ Calendar

This teaching unit is equivalent to three ECTS credits (~75-90 hours of work):

- 48 hours in class (= 64 periods of 45 minutes).
- ~27-42 hours outside of the class - we try our best to ensure you do not have
  to work that much outside of the class.

64 periods in class are planned for this course, divided in three main parts:

- Part 1 - Input/output processing (18 periods)
- Part 2 - Network programming with TCP and UDP (24 periods)
- Part 3 - Network programming with HTTP (20 periods)

Details of each course within the teaching unit are available below. Each course
is detailed with content, objectives, teaching and learning methods, and
assessment methods.

The week numbers are taken from the
[_"HEIG-VD Calendrier acad√©mique"_](https://heig-vd.ch/formation/bachelor/calendrier-academique/).
