Welcome to the
[Développement d'applications internet (DAI)](https://gaps.heig-vd.ch/consultation/fiches/uv/uv.php?id=6573)
teaching unit taught at
[Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD)](https://heig-vd.ch),
Switzerland!

## 🎯 General objectives

On completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Understand the principles of network communication and how to program
  efficient network applications.
- Use Java, Maven and Git/GitHub to develop network applications.
- Define, implement and interact with various network applications using TCP,
  UDP and HTTP protocols.
- Deploy network applications in a containerized environment with Docker and
  Docker Compose on a web infrastructure (servers, reverse proxies, caching,
  etc.).

Thanks to these skills, the student will be able to develop efficient and robust
applications that can communicate over the network (for example, business
applications, APIs, games, etc.).

[Introduction and course organization](./01-introduction-and-course-organization/README.md)!

## 📅 Program

This teaching unit consists of 64 periods. These periods are divided in three
main parts:

- Part 1 - Input/output processing (18 periods)
- Part 2 - Network programming with TCP and UDP (24 periods)
- Part 3 - Network programming with HTTP (20 periods)

The teaching unit is equivalent to three ECTS credits (~75-90 hours of work):

- 64 periods of 45 minutes (= 48 hours in class).
- ~27-42 hours outside of the class.

We try our best to ensure you do not have to work that much outside of the class
but you should expect to spend some time on the course outside of the class.

Details of each course within the teaching unit are available below. Each course
is detailed with content, objectives, teaching and learning methods, and
assessment methods.

The week numbers are taken from the
[_"HEIG-VD Calendrier académique"_](https://heig-vd.ch/formation/bachelor/calendrier-academique/).
