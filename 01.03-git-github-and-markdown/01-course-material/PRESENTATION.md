More details for this section in the [course][course]. You can find other
resources and alternatives as well.

### Git

- A version control system (VCS).
- Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds.
- Efficiently tracks changes in files.
- Used to manage source code and documentation within a project.

![bg right w:60%](https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Logo-2Color.svg)

### Architecture

- Git operates with a client-server structure:
  - Remote repositories (server).
  - Local repositories (local copies known as _clones_).
- Fully distributed VCS for offline work: each clone contains the full history.

![bg right contain](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:9d51f0ee-5946-4be2-886c-ff040ef8c1a1/03.svg?cdnVersion=1210)

### Commits, hashes and tags

- Commits represent snapshots of the repository.
- Each commit has a unique, unalterable hash.
- Tags serve as references, often for releases.
- Commit signing enhances security.

### Branches

- Tracks distinct repository versions.
- Default branch is typically named `main`.
- Branches have names and commit pointers (heads).
- Allow to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch.

### Merging branches

- Collaborative project workflow.
- Three primary merging methods:
  - Merge.
  - Rebase.
  - Squash.
- In this course, you will focus on the merge method.

### Conflicts

- Arise from simultaneous file edits.
- Git detects and requires resolution.
- Conflicts must be resolved to decide which changes to keep.
- It can be tricky but is a crucial skill.

![bg right h:80%](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

### Ignore files

- gitignore files omit specific files that should not be on the repository.
- Improves repository cleanliness and security (avoid sensitive data leaks).
- Tip: avoid online gitignore generators, they generate a lot of unnecessary
  rules.

### Summary

- Git is a distributed VCS.
- Git uses commits to track changes.
- Git uses branches to track different versions of the repository.
- Git can pull changes from a remote repository.
- Git can merge, rebase or squash branches/commits.
- Git can detect and resolve conflicts.

**We encourage you to learn how to use Git from the command line, so you can
still use it everywhere (even on a server).**

### Summary

The whole process would be as follows:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature (optional, but recommended).
2. Clone or fork the project and checkout to a new branch.
3. Make your changes, commit and push them as often as you want.
4. Create the pull request.
5. The maintainers review and merge if OK.
6. You can delete the branch or the fork.
