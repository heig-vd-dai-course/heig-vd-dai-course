## Do you know what happens when you browse the Web? How do you think it works?

<!-- _class: lead -->

## What happens when you browse the Web

1. You request a resource (e.g. a file) from a web server
2. The web server opens the file
3. The web server reads the file
4. The web server sends the file to you
5. Your web browser receives the file
6. Your web browser displays the file

The whole process uses **input/output** (IO) operations!
