<!-- _class: lead -->

## What happens when you browse the Web

1. You request a resource (e.g. a file) from a web server.
2. The web server opens the file.
3. The web server reads the file.
4. The web server sends the file to you.
5. Your web browser receives the file.
6. Your web browser displays the file.

The whole process uses **input/output** (IO) operations!
