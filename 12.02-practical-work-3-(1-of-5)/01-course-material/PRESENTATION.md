## Objectives

- Acquire a virtual machine from a cloud provider
- Access the virtual machine (SSH)
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Develop a simple CRUD API
- Deploy the applications (reverse proxy + CRUD API)
- Access the applications from a (free) domain name

---

- The CRUD API manages resources. You can choose what the CRUD API does/manages:
  - Music
  - Books
  - Video games
  - A todo/groceries list
  - ...

The CRUD API must be accessible from the internet.

## Demo

<!-- _class: lead -->

The API for the demonstration is accessible at  
<https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org>.

---

Locally - Compile the project:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Locally - Build the Docker image with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker build -t <docker tag> .
```

Locally - Publish the Docker image to the container registry:

```sh
docker push <docker tag>
```

---

On the server - Pull the Docker image from the container registry:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

On the server - Start Traefik (the reverse proxy):

```sh
docker compose -f traefik/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

On the server - Start the CRUD API:

```sh
docker compose -f api/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

---

Create a few drinks:

```sh
# Hot wine
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Hot wine with spices","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks

# Christmas tea
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Warm tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

---

Get the list of drinks:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

Output:

```json
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "Hot wine",
		"description": "Hot wine with spices",
		"price": 3.0
	}
	// All the other drinks
]
```

---

Filter the drinks with a price equal to 2.0 CHF:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks?price=2.0
```

Output:

```json
[
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Christmas tea",
		"description": "Warm tea",
		"price": 2.0
	}
]
```

---

Get a specific drink:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"name": "Hot wine",
	"description": "Hot wine with spices",
	"price": 3.0
}
```

---

Update a drink:

```sh
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Nice hot wine","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"name": "Hot wine",
	"description": "Nice hot wine",
	"price": 3.0
}
```

---

Delete a drink:

```sh
curl -X DELETE -i https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```text
HTTP/2 204
content-type: text/plain
date: Sat, 16 Dec 2023 13:31:56 GMT

```

No content as we return a `204` (No Content) status code!

---

Adding another drink with the same name:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Another tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

Output:

```text
Conflict
```

Leads to a `409` (Conflict) status code as we want to keep the names unique.

---

Get the schedules of the Baleinev hot wine week:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/schedules
```

Output:

```json
[
	{ "id": 0, "day": "MONDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
	{ "id": 1, "day": "TUESDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
	{ "id": 2, "day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
	{ "id": 3, "day": "THURSDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [22, 0] },
	{ "id": 4, "day": "FRIDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] }
]
```
