questions:
  - title: Why is UDP a connectionless protocol?
    possibleAnswers:
      - Because UDP does not require a connection to be established between the sender and the receiver before sending data.
      - Because UDP does not require a connection to a network before sending data.
    correctAnswer:
      index: 0
      explanation: |
        UDP is a connectionless protocol because it does not require a connection to be established between the sender and the receiver before sending data: just as postal cards, datagrams are sent, without know if they will be received or not.
  - title: What are the mechanisms that UDP provides to ensure that the data is received by the receiver?
    possibleAnswers:
      - None is provided by UDP, it must be implemented by the application.
      - UDP provides a mechanism to ensure that the data is received by the receiver.
    correctAnswer:
      index: 0
      explanation: |
        UDP does not provide any reliability mechanism to ensure that the data is received by the receiver.

        It is the responsibility of the application to implement the reliability mechanism.

        For example, the application can implement a mechanism to acknowledge the reception of a datagram using the request-reply pattern.

        The fire-and-forget pattern is a typical example of an unreliable mechanism.
