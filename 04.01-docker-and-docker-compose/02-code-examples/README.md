## Code examples

This directory contains several examples of Docker and Docker Compose files.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

They are ordered by complexity. You should explore them in the following order:

1. [Basic Dockerfile](./01-basic-dockerfile)
2. [Dockerfile with command](./02-dockerfile-with-command)
3. [Dockerfile with entrypoint and command](./03-dockerfile-with-entrypoint-and-command)
4. [Dockerfile with run and copy commands](./04-dockerfile-with-run-and-copy-commands)
5. [Docker run with ports](./05-docker-run-with-ports)
6. [Basic Docker Compose](./06-basic-docker-compose)
7. [Docker Compose with ports](./07-docker-compose-with-ports)
8. [Docker Compose with volumes](./08-docker-compose-with-volumes)
9. [Docker Compose with environment variables](./09-docker-compose-with-environment-variables)
10. [Make two containers communicate with each other with Docker](./10-make-two-containers-communicate-with-each-other-with-docker)
11. [Make two containers communicate with each other with Docker Compose](./11-make-two-containers-communicate-with-each-other-with-docker-compose)
