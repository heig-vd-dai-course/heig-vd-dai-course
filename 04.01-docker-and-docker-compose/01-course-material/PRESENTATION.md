More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

- Install Docker and Docker Compose.
- Configure Docker and Docker Compose to:
  - Run without `sudo` (root).
  - Start automatically at boot.

### Check and run the code examples

- Check the code examples.
- Run the code examples.
- Helps to understand the concepts.
- Modify/play with the code examples.

## Bare metal, virtualization and containerization

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Bare metal, virtualization and containerization

- Bare metal: software runs directly on hardware.
- Virtualization: software runs on a virtual machine.
- Containerization: software runs in a container.

![bg right contain](./images/bare-metal-virtualization-and-containerization.png)

### Bare metal

- The traditional way to run software.
- Software runs directly on hardware.
- Software has full access to the hardware.
- Security issues, hard to maintain, hard to migrate.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31?fit=crop&h=720)

### Virtualization

- Virtualization runs virtual machines.
- A virtual machine is a complete operating system.
- A virtual machine is isolated from the host.
- Virtual machines are heavy and use a lot of resources.

![bg right w:90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Virtualbox_logo.png)

### Containerization

- Containerization starts containers.
- Containers contain all the dependencies to run the software.
- Containers are isolated from each other.
- Containers are lightweight and use the host kernel.

## OCI, images, containers, and registries

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### OCI, images, containers, and registries

- Image: read-only template for container creation.
- Container: running instance of an image.
- Registry: service storing images.

![bg right contain](./images/oci-specification.png)

### Docker Hub

- The official registry.
- Hosts millions of images.
- Can be used to store and share images.

![bg right w:80%](./images/docker-hub.png)

### GitHub Container Registry

- GitHub's registry.
- Hosts images in the same place as the code.
- Will be used in this course for simplicity.

![bg right w:80%](./images/github-container-registry.png)

## Docker

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Docker

- Created in 2013.
- Container engine.
- Composed of two parts:
  - Docker daemon (background process).
  - Docker CLI.
- Can be used to build, run and publish containers.

![bg right w:60%](./images/docker.svg)

### Dockerfile specification

- Build a Docker image.
- Based on an existing image.
- Defines a set of instructions to build the image.
- Written in plain text.

![bg right contain](./images/dockerfile-specification.png)

### Summary

- Docker is a container engine composed of two parts: the Docker daemon and the
  Docker CLI.
- The Docker CLI is used to manage containers and images.
- The Dockerfile specification defines a standard for building Docker images.
- A Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image.
- A Docker image is used to create a container.
- A container is a runnable, isolated, instance of an image.

## Docker Compose

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Docker Compose

- Can be used to deploy a multi-container application (called a _"stack"_).
- Can be committed to Git.
- Can be used to deploy the application on any Docker host.
- Much easier than plain Docker commands.

![bg right w:60%](https://github.com/docker/compose/raw/main/logo.png)

### Docker Compose specification (1/2)

- Defines the stack:
  - Services: containers that can interact together.
  - Volumes: shared directories to store data.
  - Networks: network communications between services.

![bg right contain](./images/docker-compose-specification.png)

### Docker Compose specification (2/2)

- A Docker Compose file is written in YAML:
  - `compose.yaml` (new standard)
  - `docker-compose.yaml` (old standard).

![bg right contain](./images/docker-compose-specification.png)

### Docker Compose v1 vs. Docker Compose v2

- Docker Compose v1 written in Python (`docker-compose`)
- Docker Compose v2 written in Go (`docker compose`)
- Docker Compose v1 is deprecated

![bg right contain](./images/docker-compose-v1-vs-v2.png)

### Code examples

Check the code examples in the
[`heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`][code-examples] Git repository:

- Basic Docker Compose.
- Docker Compose with ports.
- Docker Compose with volumes.
- Docker Compose with environment variables.

### Summary

- Docker Compose allows to define a multi-container Docker application in a
  Docker Compose file.
- A Docker Compose file can consist of a set of services, volumes and networks
  called a _"stack"_.
- A Docker Compose file (`compose.yaml`) can be easily shared and versioned with
  the application.

## Questions
