## Introduction

Web applications are accessible from anywhere in the world. You can access them
from your computer, your smartphone, your tablet, etc. using a web browser,
mobile application or even a command line tool.

In this practical work, you will create a web application that uses the HTTP
protocol.

The web application will be defined by an application protocol interface (API)
and will be deployed on a virtual machine (a server). The application will be
accessible from the Internet using a domain name.

You will be able to interact with the web application using your web browser
and/or a command line tool such as curl.

The API will be defined by you.

Feel free to be creative and to create a web application that you would like to
use. It can be a web application that you would like to use in your daily life
or a web application that you would like to use for your studies. For example,
you can choose to create a web application that allows you to manage your
shopping list, a web application that allows you to manage your tasks, a web
application that allows you to manage your notes, etc. If you do not have any
idea, come to see us and we can give you.

Multiple groups can choose the same idea and you can share your methodology and
take inspiration from/help each other. However, you are not allowed to
plagiarize the code of another group. You will be penalized if you do so with 1
as the final grade.

## Objectives

- Obtain a virtual machine on a cloud provider
- Access the virtual machine with SSH
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the virtual machine
- Define some Docker Compose files to run the web application with a reverse
  proxy (Traefik)
- Deploy the simple CRUD API on the virtual machine
- Access the CRUD API from a domain name with HTTPS (Let's encrypt)

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two or three students. You can choose your
partner(s). If you do not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2024-2025 - Practical work 3 - First name Last name member 1,
  First name Last name member 2 and First name Last name member 3 (if
  applicable)
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please do it a soon as possible**, even if you do not have a clear idea yet
> as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> Please refer to the grading criteria to know what is expected from you.

## Idea validation

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

This will ensure that you have a good balance between the complexity of the
practical work and the time you have to complete it.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can help you finding some
ideas.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> While the grading criteria might not be as detailed as in the previous
> practical works for each section, you **must** continue to apply all the good
> practices you have learned so far.
>
> If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
> practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might
> penalize you.
>
> Remember the UNIX philosophy and the KISS principle: _Keep it simple, silly!_

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the Javalin dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course to implement the network
  application (you can use any other libraries for other aspects of the
  application, such as UI, etc.)
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)
- The web application can only use the HTTP/HTTPS protocols

## Tips

You are allowed to reuse your Bases de donnÃ©es relationnelles (BDR) project for
this practical work.

You can decide to merge the two projects into one if you want or keep the idea
and implement it in a different way (in memory as you will see in the course
materials).

## Submission

Your work is due as follow:

- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **19.01.2025 23:59**
- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **23.01.2025 23:59**

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Each day of delay will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the commit hash you
  want to submit

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you do not update the GitHub Discussion with the link to your repository
> and the commit hash before the deadline, it is considered as a late submission
> and you will be penalized.

## Presentations

The practical work presentations will take place in **room B51a** (the same room
as the first presentation) on:

- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **20.01.2025**
- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **24.01.2025**

We only have **7 minutes per group**. You decide what you want to show us and
how you want to present it.

**Come 5 minutes before your time slot** with your computer. You will have
access to a video projector.

The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next tables:

- [DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings)](#dai-tic-b-monday-mornings)
- [DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings)](#dai-tic-c-friday-mornings)

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
