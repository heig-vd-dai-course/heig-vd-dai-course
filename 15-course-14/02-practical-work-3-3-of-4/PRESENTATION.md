## Objectives

- Acquire a virtual machine from a cloud provider
- Access the virtual machine (SSH)
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Develop a simple CRUD API
- Deploy the applications (reverse proxy + CRUD API)
- Access the applications from a (free) domain name

---

- The CRUD API manages resources. You can choose what the CRUD API does/manages:
  - Music
  - Books
  - Video games
  - A todo/groceries list
  - ...

The CRUD API must be accessible from the internet.

## Demo

<!-- _class: lead -->

The API for the demonstration is accessible at  
<https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org>.

---

Locally - Compile the project:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Locally - Build the Docker image with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker build -t <docker tag> .
```

Locally - Publish the Docker image to the container registry:

```sh
docker push <docker tag>
```

---

On the server - Pull the Docker image from the container registry:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

On the server - Start Traefik (the reverse proxy):

```sh
docker compose -f traefik/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

On the server - Start the CRUD API:

```sh
docker compose -f api/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

---

Create a few drinks:

```sh
# Hot wine
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Hot wine with spices","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks

# Christmas tea
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Warm tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

---

Get the list of drinks:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Hot wine",
    "description": "Hot wine with spices",
    "price": 3.0
  }
  // All the other drinks
]
```

---

Filter the drinks with a price equal to 2.0 CHF:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks?price=2.0
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Christmas tea",
    "description": "Warm tea",
    "price": 2.0
  }
]
```

---

Get a specific drink:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Hot wine",
  "description": "Hot wine with spices",
  "price": 3.0
}
```

---

Update a drink:

```sh
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Nice hot wine","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Hot wine",
  "description": "Nice hot wine",
  "price": 3.0
}
```

---

Delete a drink:

```sh
curl -X DELETE -i https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks/1
```

Output:

```text
HTTP/2 204
content-type: text/plain
date: Sat, 16 Dec 2023 13:31:56 GMT

```

No content as we return a `204` (No Content) status code!

---

Adding another drink with the same name:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Another tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/drinks
```

Output:

```text
Conflict
```

Leads to a `409` (Conflict) status code as we want to keep the names unique.

---

Get the schedules of the Baleinev hot wine week:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.duckdns.org/schedules
```

Output:

```json
[
  { "id": 0, "day": "MONDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
  { "id": 1, "day": "TUESDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
  { "id": 2, "day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] },
  { "id": 3, "day": "THURSDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [22, 0] },
  { "id": 4, "day": "FRIDAY", "start": [10, 0], "end": [18, 0] }
]
```

## Group composition

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Group composition

- 2 or 3 students per group
- Create a GitHub Discussion to:
  - Announce your group members
  - Announce your idea (even a draft is fine)
- **Do it as soon as possible before next week!**
  - This helps us to plan the presentations

## Idea validation

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Idea validation

- You must state your idea on your GitHub Discussion
- We might ask you to change your idea if it is too simple or too complex
- We will help you to find a good idea if needed
- **Do it as soon as possible before next week!**

- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the Javalin dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the

## Tips

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material].

### Tips

You are allowed to reuse your Bases de données relationnelles (BDR) project for
this practical work.

You can decide to merge the two projects into one if you want or keep the idea
and implement it in a different way (in memory for example, as you will see in
the course materials).
