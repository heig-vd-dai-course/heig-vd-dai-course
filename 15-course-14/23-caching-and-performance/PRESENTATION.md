## Caching

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Caching

Process of **storing a copy of a resource to serve it faster**.

Caching can **improve the performance** of a system and **reduce the load** on
the backend.

Caching can be done on the **client-side** or **server-side**.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613443736772-e36d7fbfbaa8?fit=crop&h=720)

### Types of caching

- **Client-side caching** (private caches): once a client has received a
  response from a server, it can store the response in a cache. The next time
  the client needs the same resource, it can use the cached response instead of
  sending a new request to the server.
- **Server-side caching** (shared caches): the server stores data in a cache
  with the help of a reverse proxy or by the web application. The next time the
  server needs the same resource, it can use the cached response instead of
  processing the request again.

### CDN

Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers that are geographically
distributed around the world.

Improve performance by serving static content (images, videos, etc.) from the
closest server.

### Where to cache?

The best would be to cache at each level of the system to ensure the best
performance but it is not always possible or faisable:

- **Client-side**: the cache is stored on the client
- **Server-side**: the cache is stored on the server
- **CDN**: the cache is stored on a CDN

Private caches are caches that are only used by one client. Public caches are
caches that are used by multiple clients.

## Managing cache with HTTP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Managing cache with HTTP

Managing cache is challenging because it is difficult to know when to invalidate
the cache (the data can be stale (= outdated)).

Two main caching models:

- **Expiration model**: the cache is considered valid for a certain amount of
  time
- **Validation model**: the cache is considered valid until the data is modified

#### Expiration model

- The cache is valid for a certain amount of time
- If the cache is not expired, the cache is used
- Uses the `Cache-Control: max-age=<secondes>` header
- The cache is invalidated after the expiration time

![bg h:80%](./images/expiration-model-part-3.png)

#### Validation model

- The cache is valid until the data is modified
- If the cache is not expired, the cache is used
- Two ways to validate the cache:
  - Based on the **`Last-Modified`** header
  - Based on the **`ETag`** header

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684862030284-6b24307ebd4a?fit=crop&h=720)

#### Based on the `Last-Modified` header

- `Last-Modified`: indicates the date and time at which the resource was last
  updated.
- `If-Modified-Since`: returns a `304 Not Modified` if content is unchanged
  since the time specified in this field (= the value of the `Last-Modified`
  header).
- `If-Unmodified-Since`: returns a `412 Precondition Failed` if content has
  changed since the time specified in this field (= the value of the
  `Last-Modified` header) **when you try to update/delete the resource**.

---

![bg h:80%](./images/validation-model-based-on-the-last-modified-header-part-4.png)

#### Based on the `ETag` header

- `ETag`: provides the current entity tag for the selected representation. Think
  of it like a version number or a hash for the given resource.
- `If-None-Match`: returns a `304 Not Modified` if content is unchanged for the
  entity specified (`ETag`) by this field (= the value of the `ETag` header).
- `If-Match`: returns a `412 Precondition Failed` if content is changed for the
  entity specified (`ETag`) by this field (= the value of the `ETag` header)
  **when you try to update/delete the resource**.

### Is it possible to use both models?

Yes, it is possible to use the expiration model and the validation model at the
same time:

- No request attempt at all if the cache is not expired
- Validation model when the cache is expired

## Managing cache with proxies

### Managing cache with proxies

Proxies can cache responses to reduce the load on the backend and improve
performance.

Traefik offers a caching middleware in its Enterprise version. Out of reach for
this course.

## Managing cache with key-value stores

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can

### Managing cache with key-value stores

Redis is a popular key-value store that can be used to store cache data.

We will implement this manually in Javalin.
