## Part 1/2

<!-- _class: lead -->

In this first part, you will learn the basics of TCP and UDP programming in
Java.

### Explore the code examples

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

#### Explore the code examples

Individually, or in pair/group, **take 15 minutes to explore and discuss the
[code examples (part 1/2)](<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/07.01-java-tcp-and-udp-programming-(1-of-2)/02-code-examples>)**.

Answer the questions available in the course material:

- How do the code examples work?
- What are the main takeaways of the code examples?
- What are the main differences between the code examples?

If needed, use the theoretical content to help you.

### The Socket API

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

#### The Socket API

- Java API to create TCP and UDP network applications.
- Described in the
  [`java.net` package](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/package-summary.html)
  in the
  [`java.base` module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html).
- Originally developed by Berkeley University for the Unix operating system.
- Ported to Java and many other languages.
- Provides classes and methods to create sockets, connect to remote hosts, send
  and receive data, etc.

### TCP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

#### TCP

TCP is a transport protocol that is similar to a phone call:

1. A connection is established between two parties (unicast).
2. Data sent is guaranteed to arrive in the same order.
3. Data can be sent again if needed (retransmission).

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523966211575-eb4a01e7dd51?fit=crop&h=720)

#### TCP in the Socket API

- The Socket API provides two classes to create TCP applications:
  - [`ServerSocket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/ServerSocket.html)
    (server side).
  - [`Socket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/net/Socket.html)
    (client side).
- A TCP socket is a connection between two parties using a host and a port.
- A server socket listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
- A client socket connects to a server socket using the server's host and port.
- Once connected, data can be exchanged between the two sockets.

#### Processing data from streams

- Sockets use data streams to send and receive data, just like files:
  - Get an input stream to read data from a socket.
  - Get an output stream to write data to a socket.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594728613852-cac78bd0daba?fit=crop&h=720)

---

Get the streams from a socket:

```java
// Get input stream
input = socket.getInputStream();

// Get output stream
output = socket.getOutputStream();
```

Read and write data from/to the streams as text:

```java
// Get input stream as text
input = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

// Get output stream as text
output = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

---

Improve performance with a buffer (with a binary stream):

```java
// Get input stream as binary with buffer
input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());

// Get output stream as binary with buffer
output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
```

**Everything you have learned about Java IOs applies here!**

### UDP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

#### UDP

- A transport layer protocol just like TCP.
- Connectionless protocol - does not require to establish a connection before
  sending data.
- Unreliable protocol - does not guarantee delivery but is fast.
- Analogy: sending postcards through the postal service.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607057937337-e1a1c4e869d9?fit=crop&h=720)

#### UDP datagrams

- Datagrams are discrete chunks of data (packets) sent over the network.
- Sent individually and independently, just as postcards.
- Each datagram is self-contained and has all the information needed for routing
  and delivery, thanks to its header.
- The header contains the source's IP, source and destination ports, length,
  checksum, etc. and a payload (data).
- Maximum size of a UDP datagram is 65,535 bytes (including header).

#### Reliability

- UDP is unreliable (no guarantee of delivery, no guarantee of order).
- The application must implement its own reliability mechanism.
- In some cases, reliability is not needed (e.g. streaming).
- Handling reliability is complex - not covered in this course.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582782657732-e7d7c08dcadd?fit=crop&h=720)

#### UDP in the Socket API

- `DatagramSocket` is used to send and receive datagrams.
- A datagram is created with the `DatagramPacket` class.
- A datagram socket can send and receive datagrams to/from any host and port.
- A datagram socket can be bound to a specific port to listen for incoming
  datagrams.
- A datagram socket can be used to send and receive datagrams without
  establishing a connection.

---

![bg h:80%](./images/udp-unicast-client-server-workflow-part-4.png)

#### Processing data from datagrams

A datagram contains a payload as a byte array.

You can create a datagram with a byte array as payload:

```java
// Create a datagram with a payload and a destination address
byte[] buffer = "Hello, World!".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(
  buffer,
  buffer.length,
  InetAddress.getByName("localhost"),
  1234
);
```

---

You can get the payload of a received datagram as a byte array:

```java
// Create a datagram to receive data
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);

// Receive a datagram
socket.receive(packet);

// Get the payload of the datagram
byte[] data = packet.getData();
int length = packet.getLength();
String message = new String(data, 0, length, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

### Unicast, broadcast and multicast

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

#### Unicast, broadcast and multicast

- Unicast, broadcast and multicast are ways to send data over the network.
- TCP is unicast only - one sender and one receiver.
- UDP can be unicast, broadcast or multicast.

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542783863-dbe5c9693402?fit=crop&h=720)

#### Unicast

- One-to-one communication.
- One sender and one receiver.
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The IP address of the receiver.
  - The port of the receiver.

Think of it as a private conversation between two people.

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Unicast.svg)

#### Broadcast

- One-to-all communication.
- One sender and multiple receivers.
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The network subnet (e.g. `192.168.255.255`).
  - The port.

Think of it as a public announcement.

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Broadcast.svg)

### Multicast

- One-to-many communication.
- One sender and some receivers.
- To send a datagram, the sender must know:
  - The multicast address (between `239.0.0.0` and `239.255.255.255`).
  - The port.

Think of it as a group conversation.

![bg right:40% contain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Multicast.svg)

---

- Just as with broadcast, it can be blocked by routers.
- Broadcast/multicast are quite guaranteed **not** to work on the public
  Internet.
- Made for the local network.
- Multicast is a complex topic, not covered in depth in this course.
- The course material contains some resources.

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course]. You can find
other resources and alternatives as well.

### Service discovery protocols

- Discover services on the network.
- Service discovery protocol patterns:
  - Advertisement (passive).
  - Query (active).

## Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the . You can find other resources and
alternatives as well.

### Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

A REPL is a concept that allows you to interact with a program by sending
commands to it without restarting it.

In networking, it is used to send commands to a server that will read the
commands, evaluate them, and send back the result.

All of this is done in a loop until the client or the server decides to close
the connection.

Useful to keep a connection open and send multiple commands!

### Differences between TCP and UDP
