## Objectives

- Refresh on networking
- Learn where to find information about application protocols
- Understand application protocol
- Define application protocols
- How to use an application protocol
- **While quite short, one of the most important chapters of the course!**

## A quick reminder about networking

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### The Internet Protocol (IP)

- Each computer has a unique IP address
- IPv4 addresses are limited; NAT routers share IP addresses
- IPv6 fixes this issue
- IP addresses are used to route packets

![bg right contain](./images/the-internet-protocol-ip.png)

### The Domain Name System (DNS)

- DNS maps domain names to IP addresses
- Example: `heig-vd.ch` → `193.134.223.20`
- dig and nslookup are useful tools to query DNS servers

![bg right contain](./images/the-domain-name-system-dns.png)

### Common DNS records

Records map a domain name to an IP address.

- `NS`: Name Server
- `CNAME`: Alias
- `A`: IPv4 address
- `AAAA`: IPv6 address

![bg right contain](./images/common-dns-records.png)

### Reserved ports

- Ports identify processes or services
- Analogy: an IP address is like a street address, a port is like an apartment
  number
- Ports are 16-bit unsigned numbers, maximum 65535
- Reserved ports: 0-1023
- Other ports: far west

## What is an application protocol

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### What is an application protocol

- Defines application communication
- RFCs on the IETF website:
  - Relies on transport and network protocols
  - Multiple revisions exist

![bg right contain](./images/what-is-an-application-protocol.png)

## How is structured an application protocol

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### How is structured an application protocol

- Defined by a set of rules to follow in a RFC
- Rules define:
  - Transport protocol
  - Messages order
  - Examples and errors

![bg right contain](./images/how-is-structured-an-application-protocol.png)

## How to define an application protocol

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### How to define an application protocol

- Lot of work and thinking
- A protocol is never perfect
- The more you take your time to think and design it, the less you will have to
  change it later

- Simplified structure for this course:
  - Section 1 - Overview
  - Section 2 - Transport protocol
  - Section 3 - Messages
  - Section 4 - Examples

![bg right contain](./images/how-to-define-an-application-protocol.png)

### Section 1 - Overview

This section defines the purpose of the protocol:

- What is the goal of the protocol?
- What is the problem that it tries to solve?
- What the application protocol is used for?

### Section 2 - Transport protocol

This section defines the transport protocol used by the application protocol:

- What protocol(s) is/are involved? On which port(s)?
- How are messages/actions encoded?
- How are messages/actions delimited?
- How are messages/actions treated (text or binary)?
- Who initiates/closes the communication?
- What happens on an unknown message/action/exception?

### Section 3 - Messages

This section defines the messages that can be exchanged between the client and
the server.

- What are the messages/actions?
- What are the parameters?
- What are the return values?
- What are the exceptions?

Try to describe these for a given context, not from each point of view. It makes
it way easier to understand and to implement.

### Section 4 - Examples

This section defines examples of messages that can be exchanged between the
client and the server and the exchange order:

- What are the examples of messages/actions?
- What are the examples of exceptions?

It is important to define these examples to illustrate the protocol and to help
the reader to understand the protocol using sequence or state diagrams.

## Example - The SMS protocol

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Example - The SMS protocol

> You are working for a startup that wants to create a new communication app.
>
> The app is simple: it allows users (with unique usernames) to send small text
> messages (maximum 100 characters) to each other. The server is in charge of
> sending the messages to the recipients.
>
> You are asked to define the application protocol that will be used by the
> clients and the server.

## Questions

<!-- _class: lead -->

Do you have any questions?

## Practical content

<!-- _class: lead -->

### What will you do?

- Define two custom application protocols:
  - _"Guess the number"_ game
  - _"Temperature monitoring"_ application

These application protocols will be used in the next chapters to implement them!

## What will you do next?

In the next chapter, you will learn the following topics:

- Java TCP programming
  - How to create a TCP server
  - How to create a TCP client
  - Implement the _"Guess the number"_ game using TCP (optional)
