## Objectives

- Refresh on security
- Acquire a virtual machine (= a server) on the cloud
- Install and configure the virtual machine/server
- Learn how to use the SSH protocol to connect to a remote server
- Learn how to use the SCP protocol to transfer files to a remote server

## A quick reminder about security

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### A quick reminder about security

- A secure protocol ensures the confidentiality of the data exchanged
- Most secure protocols rely on cryptography
- Cryptography is based on algorithms and keys

## SSH

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### SSH

- Secure Shell
- Uses TCP port 22
- A protocol to connect to a remote server
- Can be used to execute commands on a remote server
- The standard way to connect to a remote server

![bg right contain](./images/ssh-1.png)

### SSH key algorithms

The most common key algorithms are:

- RSA
- DSA
- ECDSA
- Ed25519

Ed25519 and ECDSA are the recommended algorithms.

### SSH key fingerprint

- Short version of a public key
- Used to verify the identity of a public key
- Can help detect man-in-the-middle attacks
- Stored in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file

![bg right contain](./images/ssh-key-fingerprint.png)

### SSH key generation

- Use the `ssh-keygen` command
- Choose the key algorithm
- Generate a private key and a public key
- Can be done with or without a passphrase

## SCP

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the [course material][course-material]. You can
find other resources and alternatives as well.

### SCP

- Secure Copy
- Uses TCP port 22
- A protocol to transfer files to/from a remote server
- Can be used to transfer files between two remote servers as well
